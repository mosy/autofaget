<DD>If you are having difficulty understanding this concept, imagine a simple U-tube manometer where one of the tubes is opaque, and therefore one of the two liquid columns cannot be seen.  In order to be able to measure pressure just by looking at one liquid column height, we would have to make a custom scale where every inch of height registered as <SPAN  CLASS="textit">two</SPAN> inches of water column pressure, because for each inch of height change in the liquid column we can see, the liquid column we can't see also changes by an inch.  A scale custom-made for a well-type manometer is just the same concept, only without such dramatic skewing of scales.

<DD>For a simple demonstration of metal fatigue and metal &ldquo;flow,&rdquo; simply take a metal paper clip and repeatedly bend it back and forth until you feel the metal wire weaken.  Gentle force applied to the paper clip will cause it to deform in such a way that it returns to its original shape when the force is removed.  Greater force, however, will exceed the paper clip's elastic limit, causing permanent deformation and also altering the spring characteristics of the clip.

<DD>A chop saw is admittedly not a tool of finesse, and it did a fair job of mangling this unfortunate differential capacitance cell.  A bandsaw was tried at first, but made virtually no progress in cutting the hard stainless steel of the capsule assembly.  The chop saw's abrasive wheel created a lot of heat, discoloring the metal and turning the silicone fill fluid into a crystalline mass which had to be carefully chipped out by hand using an ice pick so as to not damage the thin metal sensing diaphragm.  Keep these labors in mind, dear reader, as you enjoy this textbook!

<DD>Not only did applied torque of the four capsule bolts affect measurement accuracy in the older 1151 model design, but changes in temperature resulting in changing bolt tension also had a detrimental impact on accuracy.  Most modern differential pressure transmitter designs strive to isolate the sensing diaphragm assembly from flange bolt stress for these reasons.

<DD>For example, a doubling of force results in a frequency increase of 1.414 (precisely equal to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 2.60ex; vertical-align: -0.41ex; " SRC="img41.svg"
 ALT="$\sqrt{2}$"></SPAN>).  A <SPAN  CLASS="textit">four</SPAN>-fold increase in pressure would be necessary to <SPAN  CLASS="textit">double</SPAN> the string's resonant frequency.  This particular form of nonlinearity, where diminishing returns are realized as the applied stimulus increases, yields excellent rangeability.  In other words, the instrument is inherently more sensitive to changes in pressure at the low end of its sensing range, and &ldquo;de-sensitizes&rdquo; itself toward the high end of its sensing range.

<DD>As far as I have been able to determine, the labels &ldquo;D/P&rdquo; and &ldquo;DP cell&rdquo; were originally trademarks of the Foxboro Company.  Those particular transmitter models became so popular that the term &ldquo;DP cell&rdquo; came to be applied to nearly <SPAN  CLASS="textit">all</SPAN> makes and models of differential pressure transmitter, much like the trademark &ldquo;Vise-Grip&rdquo; is often used to describe <SPAN  CLASS="textit">any</SPAN> self-locking pliers, or &ldquo;Band-Aid&rdquo; is often used to describe <SPAN  CLASS="textit">any</SPAN> form of self-adhesive bandage.

<DD>Perfect common-mode rejection is impossible for differential pressure instruments just as it is impossible for electronic voltage-measuring instruments, but in either case the effect is usually minimal.  For differential pressure transmitters, the effect of common-mode pressure on the instrument's output signal is sometimes referred to as the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">line pressure effect</SPAN> or <SPAN  CLASS="textit">static pressure effect</SPAN>, typically stated as a percentage of the instrument's upper range limit per unit of common-mode pressure.

Even pressure, which is being used here to infer measurements such as liquid level and fluid flow, is itself inferred from some other variable inside the DP instrument (e.g. capacitance, strain gauge resistance, resonant frequency)!

 HREF="node2.html#tex2html18"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">18</SPAN></SUP></A></DT>
<DD>This concept will be immediately familiar to anyone who has ever had to &ldquo;bleed&rdquo; air bubbles out of an automobile brake system.  With air bubbles in the system, the brake pedal has a &ldquo;spongy&rdquo; feel when depressed, and much pedal motion is required to achieve adequate braking force.  After bleeding all air out of the brake fluid tubes, the pedal motion feels much more &ldquo;solid&rdquo; than before, with minimal motion required to achieve adequate braking force.  Imagine the brake pedal being the isolating diaphragm, and the brake pads being the pressure sensing element inside the instrument.  If enough gas bubbles exist in the tubes, the brake pedal might stop against the floor when fully pressed, preventing full force from ever reaching the brake pads.  Likewise, if the isolating diaphragm hits a hard motion limit due to gas bubbles in the fill fluid, the sensing element will not experience full process pressure.

 HREF="node2.html#tex2html19"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">19</SPAN></SUP></A></DT>
<DD>So long as the isolating diaphragm is &ldquo;slack&rdquo; (i.e. has no appreciable tautness or resistance to movement), the pressure of the fill fluid inside the capillary tube <SPAN  CLASS="textit">will</SPAN> be equal to the pressure of whatever fluid is within the process vessel.  If any pressure imbalance were to develop between the process and fill fluids, the isolating diaphragm would immediately shift position away from the higher-pressure fluid and toward the lower-pressure fluid until equal pressures were re-established.  In real practice, isolating diaphragms do indeed have some stiffness opposing motion, and therefore do not <SPAN  CLASS="textit">perfectly</SPAN> transfer pressure from the process fluid to the fill fluid.  However, this pressure difference is usually negligible.

 HREF="node2.html#tex2html20"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">20</SPAN></SUP></A></DT>
<DD>Like all instrument diaphragms, this one is sensitive to damage from contact with sharp objects.  If the diaphragm ever becomes nicked, dented, or creased, it will tend to exhibit hysteresis in its motion, causing calibration errors for the instrument.  For this reason, isolating diaphragms are often protected from contact by a plastic plug when the instrument is shipped from the manufacturer.  This plug must be removed from the instrument before placing it into service.

<DD>Anyone familiar with &ldquo;bleeding&rdquo; air bubbles out of automotive hydraulic brake systems will understand this concept.  In order for the pedal-operated hydraulic brakes in an automobile to function as designed, the hydraulic system must be gas-free.  Incompressible liquid transfers pressure without loss of motion, whereas compressible gas bubbles will &ldquo;give&rdquo; in to pressure and result in lost brake pad motion for any given brake pedal motion.  Thus, an hydraulic brake system with air bubbles in it will have a &ldquo;spongy&rdquo; feel at the brake pedal, and may not give full braking force when needed.

<DD>Truth be told, this is a requirement for all pressure transmitter fill fluids even when isolating diaphragms are in place to prevent mixing of process and fill fluids, because no diaphragm is 100% guaranteed to seal forever.  This means <SPAN  CLASS="textit">every</SPAN> pressure transmitter must be chosen for the application in mind, since modern DP transmitters all use fill fluid in their internal sensors, whether or not the impulse lines are also filled with a non-reactive fluid.

<DD>In fact, after you become accustomed to the regular &ldquo;popping&rdquo; and &ldquo;hissing&rdquo; sounds of steam traps blowing down, you can interpret the blow-down frequency as a crude ambient temperature thermometer!  Steam traps seldom blow down during warm weather, but their &ldquo;popping&rdquo; is much more regular (one every minute or less) when ambient temperatures drop well below the freezing point of water.
