<DD>Although those adjustments made on a digital transmitter tend to be easier to perform than repeated zero-and-span adjustments on analog transmitters due to the inevitable &ldquo;interaction&rdquo; between analog zero and span adjustments requiring repeated checking and re-adjustment during the calibration period.

<DD>A 4% calibration error caused by sensor aging is enormous for any modern digital transmitter, and should be understood as an exaggeration presented only for the sake of illustrating how sensor error affects overall calibration in a smart transmitter.  A more realistic amount of sensor error due to aging would be expressed in small fractions of a percent.

<DD>HART is a hybrid analog/digital communication protocol used by a great many field instruments, allowing maintenance personnel to access and edit digital parameters inside the instrument using a computer-based interface.  Hand-held HART communicators exist for this purpose, as does HART software designed to run on a personal computer.  HART modems also exist to connect personal computers to HART-compatible field instruments.

<DD>In the case of pressure transmitters, re-trimming may be necessary if the device is ever re-mounted in a different orientation.  Changing the physical orientation of a pressure transmitter alters the direction in which gravity tugs on the sensing element, causing it to respond as though a constant bias pressure were applied to it.  This bias is often on the order of an inch of water column (or less), and usually consequential only for low-pressure applications such as furnace draft pressure.

<DD>A noteworthy exception is the case of digital instruments, which output digital rather than analog signals.  In this case, there is no need to compare the digital output signal against a standard, as digital numbers are not liable to calibration drift.  However, the calibration of a digital instrument still requires comparison against a trusted standard in order to validate an analog quantity.  For example, a digital pressure transmitter must still have its input calibration values validated by a pressure standard, even if the transmitter's digital output signal cannot drift or be misinterpreted.

 HREF="node2.html#tex2html9"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">9</SPAN></SUP></A></DT>
<DD>Modern &ldquo;smart&rdquo; electronic pressure transmitters typically boast turndown ratios exceeding 100:1, with some having turndown ratios of 200:1 or more!  Large turndown ratios are good because they allow users of instrumentation to maintain a smaller quantity of new transmitters in stock, since transmitters with large turndown ratios are more versatile (i.e. applicable to a wider variety of spans) than transmitters with small turndown ratios.

<DD>According to the book <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Philosophy in Practice</SPAN> (second edition) published by Fluke, the initial expense of their Josephson Array in 1992 was $85000, with another $25000 budgeted for start-up costs.  The annual operating cost of the array is approximately $10000, mostly due to the cost of the liquid helium refrigerant necessary to keep the Josephson junction array at a superconducting temperature.  This consumable cost does not include the salary of the personnel needed to maintain the system, either.  Presumably, a metrology lab of this caliber would employ several engineers and scientists to maintain all standards in top condition and to perform continuing metrological research.

<DD>This brings to mind a good joke.  Once there was a man who walked by an antique store every day on his way to work and noticed all the wall clocks on display at this store always perfectly matched in time.  One day he happened to see the store owner and complimented him on the consistent accuracy of his display clocks, noting how he used the owner's clocks as a standard to set his own wristwatch on his way to work.  He then asked the owner how he kept all the clocks so perfectly set.  The owner explained he set the clocks to the sound of the steam whistle at the local factory, which always blew precisely at noon.  The store owner then asked the man what he did for a living.  The man replied, &ldquo;I operate the steam whistle at the factory.&rdquo;

<DD>This, of course, assumes the potentiometer has a sufficiently fine adjustment capability that we may adjust the millivoltage signal to any desired precision.  If we were forced to use a coarse potentiometer &ndash; incapable of being adjusted to the precise amount of millivoltage we desired &ndash; then the accuracy of our calibration would also be limited by our inability to precisely control the applied voltage.

<DD>The Celsius scale used to be called the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Centigrade</SPAN> scale, which literally means &ldquo;100 steps.&rdquo;  I personally prefer the name &ldquo;Centigrade&rdquo; to the name &ldquo;Celsius&rdquo; because the former actually describes something about the unit of measurement while the latter is a surname.  In the same vein, I also prefer the older label &ldquo;Cycles Per Second&rdquo; (cps) to &ldquo;Hertz&rdquo; as the unit of measurement for frequency.  You may have noticed by now that the instrumentation world does not yield to my opinions, much to my chagrin.

<DD>Pressure does have some influence on the freezing point of most substances as well, but not nearly to the degree it has on the boiling point.  For a comparison between the pressure-dependence of freezing versus boiling points, consult a phase diagram for the substance in question, and observe the slopes of the solid-liquid phase line and liquid-vapor phase line.  A nearly-vertical solid-liquid phase line shows a weak pressure dependence, while the liquid-vapor phase lines are typically much closer to horizontal.

<DD>A &ldquo;black body&rdquo; is an idealized object having an emissivity value of exactly one (1).  In other words, a black body is a perfect radiator of thermal energy.  Interestingly, a blind hole drilled into any object at sufficient depth acts as a black body, and is sometimes referred to as a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">cavity radiator</SPAN>.
