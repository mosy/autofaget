<DD>Analytical (chemical composition) measurement is undeniably more complex and diverse than flow measurement, but analytical measurement covers a great deal of specific measurement types.  As a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">single</SPAN> process variable, flow measurement is probably the most complex.

<DD>What really matters in Newton's Second Law equation is the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">resultant</SPAN> force causing the acceleration.  This is the vector sum of all forces acting on the mass.  Likewise, what really matters in this scenario is the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">resultant</SPAN> pressure acting on the fluid plug, and this resultant pressure is the difference of pressure between one face of the plug and the other, since those two pressures impart two forces on the fluid mass in direct opposition to each other.

<DD>One of the simplifying assumptions we make in this derivation is that friction plays no significant role in the fluid's behavior as it moves through the venturi tube.  In truth, no industrial fluid flow is totally frictionless (especially through more primitive flow elements such as orifice plates), and so our &ldquo;theoretical&rdquo; equations must be adjusted a bit to match real life.

<DD>With so many modern instruments being capable of digitally implementing this square-root function, one must be careful to ensure it is only done <SPAN  CLASS="textit">once</SPAN> in the loop.  I have personally witnessed flow-measurement installations where both the pressure transmitter and the indicating device were configured for square-root characterization.  This essentially performed a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">fourth</SPAN> root characterization on the signal, which is just as bad as no characterization at all!  Like anything else technical, the key to successful implementation is a correct understanding of how the system is supposed to work.  Simply memorizing that &ldquo;the instrument must be set up with square-root to measure flow&rdquo; and blindly applying that mantra is a recipe for failure.

<DD>L.K. Spink, in his book <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Principles and Practice of Flow Meter Engineering</SPAN>, notes that drain holes intended to pass solid objects may be useless in small pipe sizes, where the hole is so small it will probably become plugged with solid debris and cease to provide benefit.  In such installations he recommends re-orienting the pipe vertically instead of horizontally.  This allows solids to pass through the main bore of the orifice without &ldquo;damming&rdquo; on the upstream side of the orifice plate.  I would add the suggestion to consider a different primary element entirely, such as a venturi tube.  The small size of the line will limit the cost of such an element, and the performance is likely to be far better than an orifice plate anyway.

<DD>What this means is that a &ldquo;pipe tap&rdquo; installation is actually measuring permanent pressure loss, which also happens to scale with the square of flow rate because the primary mechanism for energy loss in turbulent flow conditions is the translation of linear velocity to angular (swirling) velocity in the form of eddies.  This kinetic energy is eventually dissipated in the form of heat as the eddies eventually succumb to viscosity.

<DD>One installation error seen in this photograph is a green plastic impulse tube with a bend extending above the upper flange tap.  Any elevated portion of the impulse tube system will tend to collect gas bubbles over time, possibly causing measurement errors.  A better installation would ensure the impulse tubes never extend above the flange tap they connect to on the liquid-bearing pipe.

<DD>This phenomenon may be observed when watching the flow of water through a turn in a river, especially if the river is fast-moving.  Water level at the far (outside) bank of the turn will be higher than the water level at the near (inside) bank of the turn, due to radial acceleration of the water and the pressure difference that acceleration generates.  In fact, that difference in water height may even be used to estimate the river's flow rate!

<DD>The fact that a pipe elbow generates small differential pressure is an accuracy concern because other sources of pressure become larger by comparison.  Noise generated by fluid turbulence in the elbow, for example, becomes a significant portion of the pressure sensed by the transmitter when the differential pressure is so low (i.e. the signal-to-noise ratio becomes smaller).  Errors caused by differences in elbow tap elevation and different impulse line fill fluids, for example, become more significant as well.

 HREF="node3.html#tex2html21"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">21</SPAN></SUP></A></DT>
<DD>This is not always the case, as primary elements are often found on throttled process lines.  In such cases where a control valve normally throttles the flow rate, any energy dissipated by the orifice plate is simply less energy that the valve would otherwise be required to dissipate.  Therefore, the presence or absence of an orifice plate has no net impact on energy dissipation when used on a process flow throttled by a control valve.

 HREF="node3.html#tex2html22"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">22</SPAN></SUP></A></DT>
<DD>This is not to be confused with micro-turbulence in the fluid, which cannot be eliminated at high Reynolds number values.  In fact, &ldquo;fully-developed turbulent flow&rdquo; is desirable for head-based meter elements such as orifice plates because it means the flow profile will be relatively flat (even velocities across the pipe's diameter) and frictional forces (viscosity) will be negligible.  The thing we are trying to avoid is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">large-scale</SPAN> turbulent effects such as eddies, swirl, and asymmetrical flow profiles, which compromise the ability of most flowmeters to accurate measure flow rate.

<DD>L.K. Spink mentions in his book <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Principles and Practice of Flow Meter Engineering</SPAN> that certain tests have shown flow measurement errors induced from severe disturbances as far as 60 to 100 pipe diameters upstream of the primary flow element.  The April 2000 update of API standard 14.3 (for custody-transfer measurement of natural gas using orifice plates) calls for upward of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">145 pipe diameters</SPAN> of straight-length pipe upstream of the orifice plate!

 HREF="node3.html#tex2html24"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">24</SPAN></SUP></A></DT>
<DD>Flow elements with low beta ratio values tolerate greater disturbance in the flow pattern because they accelerate the flowstream to a greater degree.  This may be best visualized by a thought experiment where we imagine an orifice plate with a very large beta ratio (i.e. one where the bore size is nearly as large as the pipe diameter): such an orifice plate would hardly accelerate the fluid at all, which would mean a mis-shapen flow profile entering the bore would probably remain mis-shapen exiting it.  The acceleration imparted to a flowstream by a low-beta element tends to overshadow any asymmetries in the flow profile.  However, there are disadvantages to using low-beta elements, one of them being increased permanent pressure loss which may translate to increased operating costs due to energy loss.

<DD>Specified in Part 2 of the AGA Report #3, section 2.6.5, page 22.  A major reason for this is von Kármán vortex shedding caused by the gas having to flow around the width of the thermowell.  The &ldquo;street&rdquo; of vortices shed by the thermowell will cause serious pressure fluctuations at the orifice plate unless mitigated by a flow conditioner, or by locating the thermowell downstream so that the vortices do not reach the orifice.

<DD>Liquids can and do compress, the measurement of their &ldquo;compressibility&rdquo; being what is called the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">bulk modulus</SPAN>.  However, this compressibility is too slight to be of any consequence in most flow measurement applications.  A notable exception is the metering of diesel fuel through a high-pressure injection pump, where liquid pressures range in the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">tens of thousands</SPAN> of PSI, and the compressibility of the liquid diesel fuel may affect the precise timing of individual injections into the engine cylinders.

<DD>These figures are reported in Béla Lipták's excellent reference book <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Instrument Engineers' Handbook &ndash; Process Measurement and Analysis Volume I</SPAN> (Fourth Edition).  To be fair to closed-pipe elements such as orifice plates and venturi tubes, much improvement in the classic 3:1 rangeability limitation has been achieved through the use of microprocessor-based differential pressure sensors.  Lipták reports rangeabilities for orifice plates as great as 10:1 through the use of such modern differential pressure instruments.  However, even this pales in comparison to the rangeability of a typical weir or flume, which Lipták reports to be 75:1 for &ldquo;most devices&rdquo; in this category.

<DD>&ldquo;Custody transfer&rdquo; refers to measurement applications where a product is exchanging ownership.  In other words, someone is selling, and someone else is buying, quantities of fluid as part of a business transaction.  It is not difficult to understand why accuracy is important in such applications, as both parties have a vested interest in a fair exchange.  Government institutions also have a stake in accurate metering, as taxes are typically levied on the sale of commodity fluids such as natural gas.

<DD>The obvious solution to this problem &ndash; relocating the pipes to give more clearance between flowmeters &ndash; would be quite expensive given the large pipe sizes involved.  A &ldquo;compromise&rdquo; solution is to tilt the magnetic flowtubes as far as possible without the electrodes touching the adjacent flowtube.  Horizontal electrode installation is ideal for horizontal pipes, but an angled installation will be better than a vertical installation.

The proper unit of mass measurement in the British system is the &ldquo;slug.&rdquo;  However, for better or worse, the &ldquo;slug&rdquo; is rarely used, and so engineers have gotten into the habit of using &ldquo;pound&rdquo; as a mass measurement.  In order to distinguish the use of &ldquo;pound&rdquo; to represent mass (an intrinsic property of matter) as opposed to the use of &ldquo;pound&rdquo; to represent weight (an incidental property of matter), the former is abbreviated <SPAN  CLASS="textit">lbm</SPAN> (literally, &ldquo;pounds mass&rdquo;).  In Earth gravity, &ldquo;lbm&rdquo; and &ldquo;lb&rdquo; are synonymous.  However, the standard Newtonian equation relating force, mass, and acceleration (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.77ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img339.svg"
 ALT="$F = ma$"></SPAN>) does not work when &ldquo;lbm&rdquo; is the unit used for mass and &ldquo;lb&rdquo; is used for force (it does when &ldquo;slug&rdquo; is used for mass and &ldquo;lb&rdquo; is used for force, though!).  A weird unit of force invented to legitimize &ldquo;pound&rdquo; as an expression of mass is the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">poundal</SPAN> (&ldquo;pdl&rdquo;): one &ldquo;poundal&rdquo; of force is the reaction of one &ldquo;pound&rdquo; of mass (lbm) accelerated one foot per second squared.  By this definition, a one-pound mass (1 lbm) in Earth gravity weighs 32 poundals!

<DD>One could argue that orifice plates and other pressure-based flowmeters respond primarily to mass flow rather than volumetric flow, since their operation is based on the pressure created by <SPAN  CLASS="textit">accelerating a mass</SPAN>.  However, fluid density does affect the relationship between mass flow rate and differential pressure (note how the density term <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.64ex; vertical-align: -0.55ex; " SRC="img3.svg"
 ALT="$\rho$"></SPAN> appears in the mass flow equation <!-- MATH
 $W = k\sqrt{\rho (P_1 - P_2)}$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 3.06ex; vertical-align: -0.81ex; " SRC="img341.svg"
 ALT="$W = k\sqrt{\rho (P_1 - P_2)}$"></SPAN>, where it would not if differential pressure were a strict function of mass flow rate and nothing else), and so the raw output of these instruments must still be &ldquo;compensated&rdquo; by pressure and temperature measurements.

<DD>The impeller-turbine and twin-turbine mass flowmeter types are examples of mechanical true-mass flow technologies.  Both work on the principle of fluid inertia.  In the case of the impeller-turbine flowmeter, an impeller driven by a constant-speed electric motor imparts a &ldquo;spin&rdquo; to a moving fluid, which then impinges on a stationary turbine wheel to generate a measurable torque.  The greater the mass flow rate, the greater the impulse force imparted to the turbine wheel.  In the twin-turbine mass flowmeter, two rotating turbine wheels with different blade pitches are coupled together by a flexible coupling.  As each turbine wheel attempts to spin at its own speed, the inertia of the fluid causes a differential torque to develop between the two wheels.  The more mass flow rate, the greater the angular displacement (offset) between the two wheels.

<DD>The force coil is powered by an electronic amplifier circuit, which receives feedback from the sensor coils.  Like any amplifier circuit given positive (regenerative) feedback, it will begin to oscillate at a frequency determined by the feedback network.  In this case, the feedback &ldquo;network&rdquo; consists of the force coil, tubes, and sensor coils.  The tubes, having both resilience and mass, naturally possess their own resonant frequency.  This mechanical resonance dominates the feedback characteristic of the amplifier loop, causing the amplifier circuit to oscillate at that same frequency.

<DD>This usually takes the form of a simple analog oscillator circuit, using the tubes and sensors as feedback elements.  It is not unlike a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">crystal</SPAN> oscillator circuit where the mechanical resonance of a quartz crystal stabilizes the circuit's frequency at one value.  The feedback system naturally finds and maintains resonance, just as a crystal oscillator circuit naturally finds and maintains the resonant frequency of the quartz crystal when provided with ample regenerative (positive) feedback.  As fluid density inside the tubes changes, the tubes' mass changes accordingly, thus altering the resonant frequency of the system.  The analog nature of this mechanical oscillator explains why some early versions of Coriolis flowmeters sometimes required a minor shake or tap to the flowtubes to start their oscillation!

<DD>In a laminar flowstream, individual molecules do not cross paths, but rather travel in parallel lines.  This means only those molecules traveling near the wall of a tube will be exposed to the temperature of the wall.  The lack of &ldquo;mixing&rdquo; in a laminar flowstream means molecules traveling in the inner portions of the stream never contact the tube wall, and therefore never serve to transfer heat directly to or from the wall.  At best, those inner-path molecules transfer heat by <SPAN  CLASS="textit">conduction</SPAN> with adjacent molecules which is a less efficient transfer mechanism than convection.

<DD>This is not always the case, as primary elements are often found on throttled process lines.  In such cases where a control valve normally throttles the flow rate, any energy dissipated by the orifice plate is simply less energy that the valve would otherwise be required to dissipate.  Therefore, the presence or absence of an orifice plate has no net impact on energy dissipation when used on a process flow throttled by a control valve, and therefore does not affect cost over time due to energy loss.
