        <p><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em></p>
        <p><em>'Using a virtual twin of a production cell, makes it possible for programming and different functional
            testing of
            panels to be performed in early stages of development. A virtual twin contributes to a simpler debugging and
            to
            identify problems and minimize cost in commissioning of the production cell. The aim for the project is to
            investigate how well an emulated cell will perform compared to the real production cell in a factory
            acceptance
            test. Another objective is to investigate how you can use real CAD models in the emulation and what type of
            criteria
            the models should meet. The project had a lot of challenges and one of them was the difficulty to emulate
            the
            safety
            systems. This was solved by bypassing the safety in the PLC program. One important thing about emulation is
            communication between the different software used in the system. In this project, it proved successful to
            distribute
            the software on three computers to ease the workload of the programs used in the emulation. To use the
            emulated
            model instead of the real system is still in the research phase but in this project a lot of useful
            applications
            could be identified that could change commissioning in the future.'</em></p>

        <p><em>'Volvo Group Trucks Operations (GTO) in Sk&ouml;vde is a developing and successful company that works
            with
            continuous improvements and efficiency work tasks, to quickly enable the conditions for solve the problem.
            Volvo
            GTO
            and Projektengagemang want to rebuild the core making machine, where installation and programming of a new
            control
            system is included. To shorten the actual commissioning time in the project, Volvo has the ambition to be
            able
            to
            perform different test runs as well as to virtually verify the control system's program and function against
            an
            emulation model. The main purpose of the project is to build an emulation model in the emulation software
            Simumatik3D, where the virtual model is similar and reflects the real production equipment (Digital Twin).
            Using
            the
            model, virtual commissioning can be applied by verifying and validating the actual PLC logic against the
            emulation
            model, as well as detecting all errors prior to implementation in real life. The PLC logic is programmed in
            the
            programming software Tia Portal V14. The frame of reference has been implemented to study the theoretical
            background
            of emulation and virtual commissioning. The literature study analyzes several case studies previously done
            in
            the
            field. The model and PLC logic were validated against each other to investigate if the model is faithful.
            The
            communication between the different software has been obtained in order to control the various movements in
            the
            production system using the PLC logic. PLCSIM Advanced has been used where it represents a real PLC hardware
            to
            be
            able to execute the PLC logic in a virtual controller. An emulation model with 3D-CAD models is delivered
            and a
            virtual commissioning has been made using the model. The PLC logic has been validated and verified against
            the
            emulation model, where many different errors have been detected and corrected.'</em></p>

        <p><strong><em>Abstract</em></strong></p>
        <p><em>'Having well-trained operators is a crucial need for Volvo Group Truck Operations (GTO). Mistakes from
            the
            factory staff may cause the production line to stop, and lead to economic losses. For this reason, Volvo GTO
            has
            decided to investigate the possibility of creating an emulation model from the production line and using it
            to
            train
            operators and maintenance personnel. The aim of this thesis is to develop an Operator Training Station (OTS)
            for
            the
            OP035 of the Volvo GTO Production Line 6. In the first part, a literature research was conducted, from which
            the
            authors gained insight into related fields such as emulation, virtual environments, and operator training.
            After
            that, an emulation model of theOP035 was created using some hardware from the factory. The real PLC program
            was
            analyzed and then modified in order to implement it to the emulation model. Then, communications were
            established
            between the different parts; emulation model and PLC program. Finally, a research of the common failures and
            problems of the production line was carried out, with the aim of being able to reproduce them in the
            Operator
            Training Station. Once the OTS was implemented, several tests had undergone to validate its behavior. These
            experiments verified that the emulation model was an accurate representation of the real system and
            validated
            its
            appropriateness for the operator training application.'</em></p>

            model
            of a production cell can shorten the commissioning time since the equipment and sequence of the cell can be

            which

            equipment was found during the literature review. The software used to build the emulation model was
            Simumatik3D.
            Other software used to make the model as realistic as possible includes RobotStudio, WinCC and PLCSIM. The
            emulation
            model handles approximately 350 inputs and outputs. When the emulation model was finished experiments were
            conducted
            in order to answer research questions and to reach the main objectives. The experiments validate that the

        <p><em>To shorten project lead times Volvo Cars Sk&ouml;vde decided to explore the possibilities regarding
            verifi-cation
            of PLC-logic in simulation programs. The overall objective of the thesis was to analyze the pos-sibilities
            for
            establishing communication between the flow simulation program Plant Simulation and a PLC-device. A thorough
            understanding of the area virtual commissioning was obtained by writing the frame of reference and a
            literature
            review which served as basis for the continued practical work. Through a collection of interviews,
            discussions
            and
            an extensive literature review a better under-standing regarding how the communication between the different
            programs works, along with im-portant points that should be considered under a virtual commissioning project
            was
            obtained. A hy-pothetical system was developed in Plant Simulation by Volvo Cars Sk&ouml;vde to be used as a
            test
            sys-tem. The Simumatik3D model was created by emulating the Plant Simulation model and at the same time
            developing
            the PLC-logic in Siemens Step 7. During the development progress subsystems were verified in Simumatik3D
            against
            the
            created PLC-logic until the model was fully developed. To make sure that both the Simumatik3D model and the
            Plant
            Simulation model was valid a number of valida-tion points were tested. After the validation test the
            experimental
            phase started were different sce-narios were analyzed and tested to bring up any problems in the models to
            the
            surface. A thorough evaluation is presented in which the entire construction phase of the models is
            evaluated in
            terms of time required, advantages and disadvantages and communication with the PLC-device. The two
            pro-grams
            Simumatik3D and Plant Simulation was evaluated against one another in order to find out which program that
            is
            the
            most suited for virtual verification of PLC-logic. An overall methodology was developed based on the
            evaluation
            carried out and the experience gained from the implementa-tion of the work. The result from the developed
            methodology is presented which describes the parti-tion between the client and supplier, the communication
            between
            them and a visualization of the methodology-process. The result from the evaluation showed that Simumatik3D
            was
            more
            suitable for verification of PLC logic on a detailed level. The evaluation also showed that the PLC logic
            could
            be
            verified with Plant Simulation, but not on the same detailed level. Plant Simulation was more suit-able for
            making
            simulation models more realistic. Virtual commissioning of PLC-logic is a new con-cept on Volvo Cars
            Sk&ouml;vde
            and
            therefore can the result from this thesis form a basis for future work in this area. Virtual verification of
            PLC-logic is discussed in which several important aspects to think about is presented. The projects main
            goal to
            virtually verify PLC-logic in simulation programs was achieved and yielded good results, the partial
            objectives
            resulted in a thorough evaluation and future recommendations.'</em></p>
