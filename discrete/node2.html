Discrete process measurement</A>

<P>
<A ID="Process_switches"></A>
<P>
The word &ldquo;discrete&rdquo; means <SPAN  CLASS="textit">individual</SPAN> or <SPAN  CLASS="textit">distinct</SPAN>.  In engineering, a &ldquo;discrete&rdquo; variable or measurement refers to a true-or-false condition.  Thus, a discrete sensor is one that is only able to indicate whether the measured variable is above or below a specified setpoint. <A NAME="37"></A>

<P>
Discrete sensors typically take the form of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">switches</SPAN>, built to &ldquo;trip&rdquo; when the measured quantity either exceeds or falls below a specified value.  These devices are less sophisticated than so-called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">continuous</SPAN> sensors capable of reporting an analog value, but they are quite useful in industry. <A NAME="40"></A>

<P>
Many different types of discrete sensors exist, detecting variables such as position, fluid pressure, material level, temperature, and fluid flow rate.  The output of a discrete sensor is typically electrical in nature, whether it be an active voltage signal or just resistive continuity between two terminals on the device.

<P>

&ldquo;Normal&rdquo; status of a switch</A>
</H1>

<P>
<A ID="normal_switch"></A>
<P>
Perhaps the most confusing aspect of discrete sensors is the definition of a sensor's <SPAN  CLASS="textit">normal</SPAN> status.  Electrical switch contacts are typically classified as either <SPAN  CLASS="textit">normally-open</SPAN> or <SPAN  CLASS="textit">normally-closed</SPAN>, referring to the open or closed status of the contacts under &ldquo;normal&rdquo; conditions.  But what exactly defines &ldquo;normal&rdquo; for a switch?  The answer is not complex, but is often misunderstood due to the ambiguous nature of the word <SPAN  CLASS="textit">normal</SPAN>.  <A NAME="47"></A>

<P>
The &ldquo;normal&rdquo; status for a switch is the status its electrical contacts are in <SPAN  CLASS="textit">during a condition of no physical stimulation</SPAN>.  Another way to think of the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; status is to think in terms of the switch being <SPAN  CLASS="textit">at rest</SPAN>.  For a momentary-contact pushbutton switch, this would be the status of the switch contact when it is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">not</SPAN> being pressed.  Electrical switches are always drawn in schematic diagrams in their &ldquo;normal&rdquo; statuses, regardless of their application.  For instance, the following diagram shows a normally-open pushbutton switch controlling a lamp on a 120 volt AC circuit (the &ldquo;hot&rdquo; and &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; poles of the AC power source labeled L1 and L2, respectively):

<P>
We can tell this switch is a normally-open (NO) switch because it is drawn in an open position.  The lamp will energize only if someone presses the switch, holding its normally-open contacts in the &ldquo;closed&rdquo; position.  Normally-open switch contacts are sometimes referred to in the electrical industry as <SPAN  CLASS="textit">form-A</SPAN> contacts. <A NAME="53"></A>

<P>
If we had used a normally-closed pushbutton switch instead, the behavior would be exactly opposite.  The lamp would energize if the switch was left alone, but it would turn off if anyone pressed the switch.  Normally-closed switch contacts are sometimes referred to in the electrical industry as <SPAN  CLASS="textit">form-B</SPAN> contacts:  <A NAME="55"></A>

This seems rather simple, don't you think?  What could possibly be confusing about the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; status of a switch?  The confusion becomes evident, though, when you begin to consider <SPAN  CLASS="textit">process</SPAN> switches (i.e. switches actuated by process measurements such as pressure, flow, level, etc.).  In order to better understand this concept, we will consider a simple application of a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">flow</SPAN> switch: a switch built to actuate when a sufficient rate of fluid flows through a pipe.  <A NAME="59"></A> <A NAME="60"></A>

<P>

<P>
A flow switch is built to detect fluid flow through a pipe.  In a schematic diagram, the switch symbol appears to be a toggle switch with a &ldquo;flag&rdquo; hanging below.  The schematic diagram, of course, only shows the circuitry and not the pipe where the switch is physically mounted:

<P>
This particular flow switch is used to trigger an alarm light if coolant flow through the pipe ever falls to a dangerously low level, and the contacts are <SPAN  CLASS="textit">normally-closed</SPAN> as evidenced by the closed status in the diagram.  Here is where things get confusing: even though this switch is designated as &ldquo;normally-closed,&rdquo; it will spend most of its lifetime being held in the open status by the presence of adequate coolant flow through the pipe.  Only when the flow through the pipe slows down enough will this switch return to its &ldquo;normal&rdquo; status and conduct electrical power to the lamp.  In other words, the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; status for this switch (closed) is actually an <SPAN  CLASS="textit">abnormal</SPAN> status for the process it operates within (low flow), for the simple reason that the switch should be stimulated and not at rest while the process is operating as it should.  

<P>
Students often wonder why process switch contacts are labeled according to this convention of &ldquo;no stimulation&rdquo; instead of according to the typical status of the process in which the switch is used.  The answer to this question is that the manufacturer of the switch has no idea whatsoever as to your intended use.  A flow switch manufacturer does not know or care whether their product gets used as a low-flow detector or as a high-flow detector.  In other words, the manufacturer cannot predict what the typical status of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">your</SPAN> process will be, and so the definition of &ldquo;normal&rdquo; status for the switch must be founded on some common criterion unrelated to your particular application.  That common criterion is the resting status: when the sensor is exposed to the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">least</SPAN> (or no) amount of stimulation from the process it senses.

<P>
<P>
Here is a listing of &ldquo;normal&rdquo; definitions for various process switch types:

<P>

<UL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Limit switch</SPAN>: target not contacting the switch
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Proximity switch</SPAN>: target far away
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Pressure switch</SPAN>: low pressure (or even a vacuum)
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Level switch</SPAN>: low level (empty)
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Temperature switch</SPAN>: low temperature (cold)
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Flow switch</SPAN>: low flow rate (fluid stopped)
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
These are the conditions represented by the switch statuses shown in a schematic diagram.  These may very well <SPAN  CLASS="textit">not</SPAN> be the statuses of the switches when they are exposed to <SPAN  CLASS="textit">typical</SPAN> operating conditions in the process.

<P>

<P>
A helpful tip to remember about process switches and their respective schematic diagram symbols is that the symbols are conventionally drawn in such a way that an <SPAN  CLASS="textit">upward</SPAN> motion of the movable switch element represents <SPAN  CLASS="textit">increasing stimulus</SPAN>.  Here are some examples of this, showing various process switch types and NO/NC contact configurations, comparing their states with no stimulus versus when the stimulus exceeds the each switch's threshold or &ldquo;trip&rdquo; setting.  The <SPAN  CLASS="textit">normal</SPAN> status of each switch as defined by the manufacturer is labeled in green text:

It is imperative<A ID="tex2html1"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot80"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN></SUP></A> to remember that the way a switch is drawn in a schematic diagram merely represents its &ldquo;normal&rdquo; status as defined by the manufacturer.  This may or may not be the switch's status during &ldquo;typical&rdquo; operation of the process, and it may or may not be the status of that switch at the time of concern when you are examining the schematic!  The &ldquo;normal&rdquo; status of a switch means just one thing: what that switch will do when subjected to minimum stimulus &ndash; that is to say, what it will do when its stimulus is less than the actuation threshold of the switch.  <A NAME="81"></A>

<P>

<P>
For example, the LED in this circuit will turn on if the liquid level rises above 14 inches <SPAN  CLASS="textit">and</SPAN> the pressure falls below 22 PSI <SPAN  CLASS="textit">and</SPAN> either the flow is less than 3 gallons per minute <SPAN  CLASS="textit">or</SPAN> the temperature is greater than 125 degrees Fahrenheit:

<P>
Since we know we need a switch to be <SPAN  CLASS="textit">closed</SPAN> in order to conduct electricity and provide a path for current in this circuit, we are looking for the necessary conditions to close each switch.  For any normally-closed (NC) switch, this means a stimulus value less than the actuation threshold.  For any normally-open (NO) switch, this means a stimulus value great enough to exceed the threshold and &ldquo;hold&rdquo; the switch in its actuated state.  Since the flow and pressure switches in this circuit are both NC, we are looking for flow and pressure values less than the respective settings.  Since the level and temperature switches are both NO, we are looking for level and temperature values in excess of their respective settings.

<P>
<P>
The present status of a switch may be determined by comparing its stimulating quantity against its trip (threshold) setting.  A switch will be in its &ldquo;normal&rdquo; (resting) state when the stimulus value is less than the threshold value.  Conversely, a switch will be in its &ldquo;actuated&rdquo; state when the stimulus value exceeds the threshold value.  Determination of a switch's status, therefore, is a matter of comparing the stimulus quantity to the threshold &ldquo;trip&rdquo; setting.  One cannot simply look at the schematic diagram to tell what the switch is doing &ndash; one must <SPAN  CLASS="textit">compare</SPAN> the switch's setting versus against a known stimulus value in order to tell whether it will be in its resting state or not.

<P>
Likewise, if we happen to know the switch's present status in a system, we may qualitatively determine the stimulating quantity by comparing the present status against the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; (resting) status.  If a switch is in its resting state, then the stimulating quantity must be less than the trip threshold.  If a switch is in its actuated (non-normal) state, then the stimulating quantity must be greater than the trip threshold<A ID="tex2html2"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot303"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN></SUP></A>.  The next example showcases these determinations.

In this next example, we see a pictorial representation of multiple switches wired to the discrete input channels of a programmable logic controller (PLC), with red LED indicators denoting the real-time status of each input on the PLC:

<P>
We may determine a switch's degree of stimulation by comparing its present status with its &ldquo;normal&rdquo; status.  If a switch happens to be in the same state as its normal state (i.e. resting), we know its stimulus must be less than the threshold (trip) value.  If a switch happens to be in the opposite state as its normal state (i.e. actuated), we know its stimulus has exceeded the threshold (trip) value.  The states of these four switches may be shown in a table:

A <SPAN  CLASS="textit">limit switch</SPAN> detects the physical motion of an object by direct contact with that object.  An example of a limit switch is the switch detecting the open position of an automobile door, automatically energizing the cabin light when the door opens.  <A NAME="119"></A>

<P>
Limit switches find many uses in industry, particular in robotic control and CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machine tool systems.  In many motion-control systems, the moving elements have &ldquo;home&rdquo; positions where the computer assigns a position value of zero.  For example, the axis controls on a CNC machine tool such as a lathe or mill all return to their &ldquo;home&rdquo; positions upon start-up, so the computer can know with confidence the starting locations of each piece.  These home positions are detected by means of limit switches.  The computer commands each servo motor to travel fully in one direction until a limit switch on each axis trips.  The position counter for each axis resets to zero as soon as the respective limit switch detects that the home position has been reached.  <A NAME="123"></A>

<P>
A typical limit switch design uses a roller-tipped lever to make contact with the moving part.  Screw terminals on the switch body provide connection points with the NC and NO contacts inside the switch.  Most limit switches of this design share a &ldquo;common&rdquo; terminal between the NC and NO contacts like this:

A common coloring convention for electronic proximity switches is brown for +V power supply, blue for ground (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.74ex; vertical-align: -0.29ex; " SRC="img19.svg"

<P>
An electronic switch designed to sink current through its signal wire is alternatively referred to as an <SPAN  CLASS="textit">NPN</SPAN> switch due to the type of transistor used in its output.  Conversely, an electronic switch designed to source current through its signal wire may be referred to as a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">PNP</SPAN> switch.  The key to understanding these labels is to recognize the emitter terminal of the output transistor is always the one connected to the power supply rail.  For a sinking switch, this means the emitter must connect to the negative rail, necessitating<A ID="tex2html4"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot305"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN></SUP></A> an NPN transistor to do the switching.

Like other types of process switches, proximity switches come in both &ldquo;normally open&rdquo; (NO) and &ldquo;normally closed&rdquo; (NC) varieties.  This distinction has nothing whatsoever to do with sourcing versus sinking (PNP vs. NPN), but rather what the status of the proximity switch will be when no objects are near.  Thus, it is possible to find normally-open proximity switches that are sinking (NPN) as well as normally-open proximity switches that are sourcing (PNP), and normally-closed proximity switches in either sinking or sourcing designs as well.

<P>
These switch characteristics are commonly fixed, and must be specified when ordering the device.  Likewise, the detection range of a proximity switch is usually a fixed parameter rather than being adjustable.

A legacy design of pressure switch uses a bourdon tube as the pressure-sensing element, and a glass bulb partially filled with mercury as the electrical switching element.  When applied pressure causes the bourdon tube to flex sufficiently, the glass bulb tilts far enough to cause the mercury to fall against a pair of electrodes, thus completing an electrical circuit.  A great many pressure switches of this design were sold under the brand name of &ldquo;Mercoid,&rdquo; with a few appearing in this photograph of a steam boiler (the round-shaped units with glass covers allowing inspection of the bourdon tube and mercury tilt switch):  <A NAME="180"></A>  <A NAME="181"></A>  <A NAME="182"></A>

The electrical switch element is located underneath the blue cover, while the diaphragm pressure element is located within the grey metal housing.  The net force exerted on the diaphragm by the two fluid pressures varies in magnitude and direction with the magnitude of those pressures.  If the two fluid pressures are precisely equal, the diaphragm experiences no net force (zero differential pressure).

Like the Danfoss gauge pressure switch seen previously, this differential pressure switch has a &ldquo;trip&rdquo; or &ldquo;limit&rdquo; setting as well as a &ldquo;dead-band&rdquo; or &ldquo;differential&rdquo; setting.

Like all other process switches, temperature switches exhibit a certain amount of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">deadband</SPAN> in their switching action.  A temperature switch that trips at 300 <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.70ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img43.svg"
 ALT="$^{o}$"></SPAN>F <SPAN  CLASS="textit">rising</SPAN>, for example, will not re-set at 300 <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.70ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img43.svg"
 ALT="$^{o}$"></SPAN>F <SPAN  CLASS="textit">falling</SPAN>.  That switch would more likely reset at some lower temperature such as 295 <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.70ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img43.svg"
 ALT="$^{o}$"></SPAN>F.  With mechanical switch designs, some amount of deadband is inevitable due to friction inside the mechanism.  However, process switch deadband is actually a useful characteristic as it helps avoid repeated &ldquo;nuisance&rdquo; alarms from happening.    <A NAME="263"></A>

<P>
To understand this concept, it is helpful to imagine a scenario where the process variable is at or very near the trip point.  For our hypothetical temperature switch with a trip point of 300 <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.70ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img43.svg"
 ALT="$^{o}$"></SPAN>F (rising), imagine a situation where the process temperature is precisely 300.0 <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.70ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img43.svg"
 ALT="$^{o}$"></SPAN>F.  Any further rise in temperature will of course trip the switch (sounding an alarm).  With no deadband, however, the switch will immediately re-set when the temperature falls back down to 300.0 <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.70ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img43.svg"
 ALT="$^{o}$"></SPAN>F.  This means the switch may possibly &ldquo;cycle&rdquo; back and forth between its trip and reset states with just a minute change in process temperature (300.0 <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.70ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img43.svg"
 ALT="$^{o}$"></SPAN>F to 300.1 <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.70ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img43.svg"
 ALT="$^{o}$"></SPAN>F and back again).  If the temperature switch is activating an alarm every time it trips, it will create a series of alarm events prompting operators to repeatedly acknowledge the alarm.  This is a nuisance to operations personnel, as it distracts them from addressing what they already realize is a process problem.  It is better for the switch to trip at 300.0 <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.70ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img43.svg"
 ALT="$^{o}$"></SPAN>F rising <SPAN  CLASS="textit">and remain in that tripped state</SPAN> until the temperature falls down to some degree substantially below the trip point.  This way, the operators only receive <SPAN  CLASS="textit">one</SPAN> alarm event rather than multiple alarm events for each process temperature excursion.

<P>
Some mechanical temperature switches come equipped with a separate adjustment for deadband (also called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">differential</SPAN>).  Setting this deadband adjustment in a mechanical temperature switch requires the technician to repeatedly subject the sensing element to a rising and falling temperature, to check that the switch trips at the proper setting and resets at the proper setting.  This is analogous to cycling the process variable back and forth when adjusting the &ldquo;zero&rdquo; and &ldquo;span&rdquo; settings of an analog transmitter: checking to see that the transmitter repeatedly outputs a 0% signal at the lower range value (LRV) and a 100% signal at the upper range value (URV).  <A NAME="273"></A>

For discrete temperature-sensing applications demanding high accuracy and repeatability, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">electronic</SPAN> temperature switch circuits using thermocouples, RTDs, or thermistors may be used instead of a mechanical (bi-metallic or filled bulb) sensing element.  The operation and configuration of discrete electronic temperature switches is very similar to that of continuous electronic temperature transmitters.  

<P>
An example of an electronic temperature switch module is the Moore Industries model SPA (&ldquo;Site Programmable Alarm&rdquo;), shown here:  <A NAME="275"></A>

Not only is this particular model capable of directly interpreting both RTD and thermocouple signals, but it will also input 4-20 mA loop current signals as well.  This means you may build a temperature switch system out of a 4-20 mA loop-powered temperature transmitter (located in the field) and an SPA switch module (located in a protected environment such as a control room or electrical enclosure).  Many other manufacturers and models of electronic switching units exist, with the Moore Industries SPA being just one example.

<P>
With electronic temperature switches, the adjustment of deadband (differential) is both precise and flexible.  Unlike mechanical switches where deadband is primarily a function of friction, and therefore liable to change over time as the device wears, electronic switching circuits may be precisely set for any trip and reset points along its measurement range, remaining very stable over time.

Flow switches</A>

A <SPAN  CLASS="textit">flow switch</SPAN> is one detecting the flow of some fluid through a pipe.  Flow switches often use &ldquo;paddles&rdquo; as the flow-sensing element, the motion of which actuates one or more switch contacts. <A NAME="279"></A>

Recall from section <A HREF="#normal_switch">1.1</A> that the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; status of a switch is the resting condition of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">no stimulation</SPAN>.  A flow switch will be in its &ldquo;normal&rdquo; status when it senses minimum flow (i.e. no fluid moving through the pipe).  For a flow switch, &ldquo;normal&rdquo; status is any fluid flow rate <SPAN  CLASS="textit">below</SPAN> the trip threshold of the switch.  <A NAME="283"></A>

A simple paddle placed in the midst of a fluid stream generates a mechanical force which may be used to actuate a switch mechanism, as shown in the following photograph:

Like all other process switches, flow switches exhibit <SPAN  CLASS="textit">deadband</SPAN> (also called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">differential</SPAN>) in their switching action.  A flow switch that trips at 15 GPM <SPAN  CLASS="textit">rising</SPAN>, for example, will not re-set at 15 GPM <SPAN  CLASS="textit">falling</SPAN>.  That switch would more likely reset at some lower flow rate such as 14 GPM.  With the &ldquo;trip&rdquo; and &ldquo;reset&rdquo; points being different, the switch avoids unnecessary cycling if the process flow rate hovers near one critical value.   <A NAME="290"></A>  <A NAME="291"></A>
