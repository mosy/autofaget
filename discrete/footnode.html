<DD>Mistaken interpretations of switch status remains one of the most resilient misconceptions for students first learning this topic.  It seems that a great many students prefer to think of a switch's drawn status as its status at the present moment (e.g. when the process is running as expected).  I believe the heart of this misconception is the meaning of the word &ldquo;normal,&rdquo; which to most peoples' minds refers to &ldquo;the way things typically are.&rdquo;

 HREF="node2.html#tex2html3"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN></SUP></A></DT>
<DD>This curious label is used to describe switch contacts lacking their own built-in power source, as opposed to a switch contained in a device that also provides power to drive the switch circuit.  Dry contacts may be mechanical in nature, or they may be electronic (e.g. transistor).  By contrast, a &ldquo;wet&rdquo; contact is one already connected to an internal power source, ready to drive a load with no other external components needed.

<DD>To be honest, one <SPAN  CLASS="textit">could</SPAN> use an NPN transistor to source current or a PNP to sink, but it would require the transistor be used in the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">common-collector</SPAN> configuration which does not allow for saturation.  The engineers designing these proximity switches strive for complete saturation of the transistor, in order to achieve minimum &ldquo;on&rdquo; resistance, and that requires a common-emitter configuration.

<DD>If the trip setting of a pressure switch is below atmospheric pressure, then it will be &ldquo;actuated&rdquo; at atmospheric pressure and in its &ldquo;normal&rdquo; status only when the pressure falls below that trip point (i.e. a vacuum).

<DT><A ID="foot306">... flux</A><A
 HREF="node2.html#tex2html7"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">7</SPAN></SUP></A></DT>
<DD>The reason for this opposition is rooted in the roles of primary and secondary coils as power <SPAN  CLASS="textit">load</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">source</SPAN>, respectively.  The voltage across each coil is a function of Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction: <!-- MATH
 $V = N{d \phi \over dt}$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 3.08ex; vertical-align: -0.90ex; " SRC="img39.svg"
 ALT="$V = N{d \phi \over dt}$"></SPAN>.  However, since the primary coil acts as a load (drawing power from the 120 VAC source) and the secondary coil acts as a source (sending power to the probes), the directions of current through the two coils will be opposite despite their common voltage polarities.  The secondary coil's opposite current direction causes an opposing magnetic force in that section of the core, reducing the magnetic flux there.  In a normal power transformer, this reduction in magnetic flux caused by secondary current is also felt by the primary coil (since there is only one magnetic &ldquo;path&rdquo; in a power transformer's core), which then causes the primary coil to draw more current and re-establish the core flux at its original magnitude.  With the inductive relay, however, the opposing magnetic force created by the secondary coil simply forces more of the primary coil's magnetic flux to bypass to the alternate route: through the armature.

<DD>If the trip setting of a temperature switch is below ambient temperature, then it will be &ldquo;actuated&rdquo; at ambient temperature and in its &ldquo;normal&rdquo; status only when the temperature falls below that trip point (i.e. colder than ambient).
