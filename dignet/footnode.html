<DD>HART communications occur at a rate of 1200 bits per second, and it is this slow by design: this slow data rate avoids signal reflection problems that would occur in unterminated cables at higher speeds.  For more insight into how and why this works, refer to the &ldquo;transmission lines&rdquo; section <A HREF="#transmission_lines"><IMG  ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A> beginning on page <A HREF="#transmission_lines"><IMG  ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A>.  An example of a &ldquo;slow&rdquo; process variable suitable for HART digital monitoring or control is the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">temperature</SPAN> of a large building or machine, where the sheer mass of the object makes temperature changes slow by nature, and therefore does not require a fast digital data channel to report that temperature.

<DD>In the early days of personal computers, many microprocessor chips lacked floating-point processing capability.  As a result, floating-point calculations had to be implemented in software, with programmed algorithms instructing the microprocessor how to do floating-point arithmetic.  Later, floating-point processor chips were added alongside the regular microprocessor to implement these algorithms in hardware rather than emulated them through software, resulting in increased processing speed.  After that, these floating-point circuits were simply added to the internal architecture of microprocessor chips as a standard feature.  Even now, however, computer programmers understand that floating-point math requires more processor cycles than integer math, and should be avoided in applications where speed is essential and floating-point representation is not.  In applications demanding a small microprocessor chip and optimum speed (e.g. embedded systems), fixed-point notation is best for representing numbers containing fractional quantities.

<DD>Note how the place-weights shown for the exponent field do not seem to allow for negative values.  There is no negative place-weight in the most significant position as one might expect, to allow negative exponents to be represented.  Instead the IEEE standard implies a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">bias value</SPAN> of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.88ex; vertical-align: -0.29ex; " SRC="img29.svg"
 ALT="$-127$"></SPAN>.  For example, in a single-precision IEEE floating-point number, an exponent value of 11001101 represents a power of 78 (since 11001101 = 205, the exponent's actual value is 205 <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.74ex; vertical-align: -0.29ex; " SRC="img6.svg"
 ALT="$-$"></SPAN> 127 = 78).

<DD>It is also possible to &ldquo;simulate&rdquo; fractional resolution using an integer number, by having the HMI insert a decimal point in the numerical display.  For instance, one could use a 16-bit signed integer having a numerical range of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.88ex; vertical-align: -0.29ex; " SRC="img12.svg"
 ALT="$-32768$"></SPAN> to +32767 to represent motor temperature by programming the HMI to insert a decimal point between the hundreds' and the tens' place.  This would give the motor temperature tag a (displayed) numerical range of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.88ex; vertical-align: -0.29ex; " SRC="img36.svg"
 ALT="$-327.68$"></SPAN> degrees to +327.67 degrees, and a (displayed) resolution of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.74ex; vertical-align: -0.29ex; " SRC="img35.svg"
 ALT="$\pm$"></SPAN>0.01 degree.  This is basically the concept of a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">fixed-point</SPAN> number, where a fixed decimal point demarcates whole digits (or bits) from fractional digits (or bits).

<DD>Morse code is an example of a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">self-compressing</SPAN> code, already optimized in terms of minimum bit count.  Fixed-field codes such as Baudot and the more modern ASCII tend to waste bandwidth, and may be &ldquo;compressed&rdquo; by removing redundant bits.

<DD>For example, the Baudot code 11101 meant either &ldquo;Q&rdquo; or &ldquo;1&rdquo; depending on whether the last shift character was &ldquo;letters&rdquo; or &ldquo;figures,&rdquo; respectively.  The code 01010 meant either &ldquo;R&rdquo; or &ldquo;4&rdquo;.  The code 00001 meant either &ldquo;T&rdquo; or a &ldquo;5&rdquo;.  This overloading of codes is equivalent to using the &ldquo;shift&rdquo; key on a computer keyboard to switch between numbers and symbols (e.g. &ldquo;5&rdquo; versus &ldquo;%&rdquo;, or &ldquo;8&rdquo; versus &ldquo;*&rdquo;).  The use of a &ldquo;shift&rdquo; key on a keyboard allows single keys on the keyboard to represent multiple characters.

 HREF="node2.html#tex2html13"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">13</SPAN></SUP></A></DT>
<DD>The origin of this word has to do with the way many ADC circuits are designed, using binary <SPAN  CLASS="textit">counters</SPAN>.  In the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">tracking</SPAN> design of ADC, for instance, an up-down binary counter &ldquo;tracks&rdquo; the varying analog input voltage signal.  The binary output of this counter is fed to a DAC (digital-to-analog converter) sending an analog voltage to a comparator circuit, comparing the digital counter's equivalent value to the value of the measured analog input.  If one is greater than the other, the up-down counter is instructed to either count up or count down as necessary to equalize the two values.  Thus, the up-down counter repeatedly steps up or down as needed to keep pace with the value of that analog voltage, its digital output literally &ldquo;counting&rdquo; steps along a fixed scale representing the full analog measurement range of the ADC circuit.

<DD>Whether or not the actual ADC will round <SPAN  CLASS="textit">down</SPAN> depends on how it is designed.  Some ADCs round down, others &ldquo;bobble&rdquo; equally between the two nearest digital values, and others yet &ldquo;bobble&rdquo; proportionately between the two nearest values.  No matter how you round in your calculation of count value, you will never be more than 1 count off from the real ADC's value.

 HREF="node2.html#tex2html16"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">16</SPAN></SUP></A></DT>
<DD>A mechanical demonstration of aliasing may be seen by using a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">stroboscope</SPAN> to &ldquo;freeze&rdquo; the motion of a rotating object.  If the frequency of a flashing strobe light is set to exactly match the rotational speed of the object (e.g. 30 Hz flashing = 1800 RPM rotation), the object will appear to stand still because your eyes only see the object when it is at the exact same position every flash.  This is equivalent to sampling a sinusoidal signal exactly once per cycle: the signal appears to be constant (DC) because the sine wave gets sampled at identical points along its amplitude each time.  If the strobe light's frequency is set slightly slower than the object's rotational speed, the object will appear to slowly rotate in the forward direction because each successive flash reveals the object to be in a slightly further angle of rotation than it was before.  This is equivalent to sampling a sinusoidal signal at a rate slightly slower than the signal's frequency: the result appears to be a sinusoidal wave, but at a much slower frequency.

 HREF="node2.html#tex2html17"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">17</SPAN></SUP></A></DT>
<DD>Remember that an ADC has a finite number of &ldquo;counts&rdquo; to divide its received analog signal into.  A 12-bit ADC, for example, has a count range of 0 to 4095.  Used to digitize an analog signal spanning the full range of 0 to 5 VDC, this means each count will be &ldquo;worth&rdquo; 1.22 millivolts.  This is the minimum amount of signal voltage that a 12-bit, 0-5 VDC converter is able to resolve: the smallest increment of signal it is able to uniquely respond to.  1.22 mV represents 0.037% of 3.3 volts, which means this ADC may &ldquo;resolve&rdquo; down to the very respectable fraction 0.037% of the solar panel's 33 volt range.  If we were to use the same ADC range to directly measure the shunt resistor's voltage drop (0 to 0.54 VDC), however, it would only be able to resolve down to 0.226% of the 0 to 5.4 amp range, which is much poorer resolution.

<DD>There is, of course, the issue of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">reliability</SPAN>.  Communicating thousands of process data points over a single cable may very well represent a dramatic cost savings in terms of wire, junction boxes, and electrical conduit.  However, it also means you will lose all those thousands of data points if that one cable becomes severed!  Even with digital technology, there may be reason to under-utilize the bandwidth of a signal cable.

<DD>I do not expect any reader of this book to have firsthand knowledge of what a &ldquo;telegraph&rdquo; is, but I suspect some will have never heard of one until this point.  Basically, a telegraph was a primitive electrical communication system stretching between cities using a keyswitch at the transmitting end to transmit on-and-off pulses and a &ldquo;sounder&rdquo; to make those pulses audible on the receiving end.  Trained human operators worked these systems, one at the transmitting end (encoding English-written messages into a series of pulses) and one at the receiving end (translating those pulses into English letters).

 HREF="node2.html#tex2html24"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">24</SPAN></SUP></A></DT>
<DD>&ldquo;Asynchronous&rdquo; refers to the transmitting and receiving devices not having to be in perfect synchronization in order for data transfer to occur.  Every industrial data communications standard I have ever seen is asynchronous rather than synchronous.  In synchronous serial networks, a common &ldquo;clock&rdquo; signal maintains transmitting and receiving devices in a constant state of synchronization, so that data packets do not have to be preceded by &ldquo;start&rdquo; bits or followed by &ldquo;stop&rdquo; bits.  Synchronous data communication networks are therefore more efficient (not having to include &ldquo;extra&rdquo; bits in the data stream) but also more complex.  Most long-distance, heavy traffic digital networks (such as the &ldquo;backbone&rdquo; networks used for the Internet) are synchronous for this reason.

<DD>This is most definitely <SPAN  CLASS="textit">not</SPAN> the case with NRZ encoding.  To see the difference for yourself, imagine a continuous string of either &ldquo;0&rdquo; or &ldquo;1&rdquo; bits transmitted in NRZ encoding: it would be nothing but a straight-line DC signal.  In Manchester encoding, it is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">impossible</SPAN> to have a straight-line DC signal for an indefinite length of time.  Manchester signals <SPAN  CLASS="textit">must</SPAN> oscillate at a minimum frequency equal to the clock speed, thereby guaranteeing all receiving devices the ability to detect that clock speed and thereby synchronize themselves with it.

<DD>It is relatively easy to build an apparatus that makes HART tone signals audible: simply connect a small audio speaker to the low-impedance side of an audio transformer (8 ohms) and then connect the high-impedance side of that transformer (typically 1000 ohms) to the HART signal source through a coupling capacitor (a few microfarads is sufficient).  When HART communications are taking place, you can hear the FSK tones reproduced by the speaker, which sound something like the noises made by a fax machine as it communicates over a telephone line.

<DD>The way hardware-based flow control works in the EIA/TIA-232 standard involves two lines labeled RTS (&ldquo;Request To Send&rdquo;) and CTS (&ldquo;Clear To Send&rdquo;) connecting the two devices together on a point-to-point serial network in addition to the TD (&ldquo;Transmitted Data&rdquo;) and RD (&ldquo;Received Data&rdquo;) and signal ground lines.  Like the TD and RD terminals which must be &ldquo;crossed over&rdquo; between devices such that the TD of one device connects to the RD of the other device and vice-versa, the RTS and CTS terminals of the two devices must be similarly crossed.  The RTS is an output line while the CTS is an input, on both devices.  When a device is able to receive data, it activates its RTS output line to <SPAN  CLASS="textit">request</SPAN> data.  A device is not permitted to transmit data on its TD line until it is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">cleared</SPAN> to send data by an active state on its CTS input line.

<DD>These very same problems may arise in FOUNDATION Fieldbus networks, for the exact same reason: the cabling is passive (for increased reliability).  This makes FOUNDATION Fieldbus instrument systems challenging to properly install for most applications (except in really simple cases where the cable route is straightforward), which in my mind is its single greatest weakness at the time of this writing (2009).  I strongly suspect Ethernet's history will repeat itself in FOUNDATION Fieldbus at some later date: a system of reliable &ldquo;hub&rdquo; devices will be introduced so that these problems may be averted, and installations made much simpler.

<DD>Even the cost difference is negligible.  It should be noted, though, that switches may exhibit unintended behavior if a cable is unplugged from one of the ports and re-plugged into a different port.  Since switches internally map ports to device addresses, swapping a device from one port to another will &ldquo;confuse&rdquo; the switch until it re-initializes the port identities.  Re-initialization may be forced by cycling power to the switch, if the switch does not do so on its own.

<DD>The term &ldquo;loopback&rdquo; refers to an old trick used by network technicians to diagnose suspect serial port connections on a computer.  Using a short piece of copper wire (or even a paperclip) to &ldquo;jumper&rdquo; pins 2 and 3 on an EIA/TIA-232 serial port, any serial data transmitted (out of pin 3) would be immediately received (in pin 2), allowing the serial data to &ldquo;loop back&rdquo; to the computer where it could be read.  This simple test, if passed, would prove the computer's low-level communication software and hardware was working properly and that any networking problems must lie elsewhere.

Furthermore, if we assume a grain of sand has a mass of about 1 milligram, and that the Earth is modeled as a very large collection of sand grains (not quite the truth, but good enough for a dramatic illustration!), we arrive at 57 <SPAN  CLASS="textit">million</SPAN> IPv6 addresses per grain of sand on Earth.

<DD>The &ldquo;ping&rdquo; command is often used to test the response of a single IP node on a network, by issuing the command followed by the IP address of interest (e.g. <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">ping 192.168.35.70</SPAN>).  By contrast, a &ldquo;broadcast&rdquo; ping request attempts to contact a range of IP addresses within a subnet.  For example, if we wished to ping all the IP addresses beginning with <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">192.168.35</SPAN>, we would issue the command with all 1's in the last octet of the IP address field (e.g. <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">ping 192.168.35.255</SPAN>).

<DD>Truth be told, HART instruments configured to operate in burst mode are still able to respond to queries from a master device, just not as often.  Between bursts, the HART slave device waits a short time to allow any master devices on the network to poll.  When polled, the slave device will respond as it normally would, then resumes its bursts of unpolled data once again.  This means that normal master/slave communication with a HART instrument set for burst mode will occur at a slower pace than if the instrument is set for normal mode.

<DD>Recall that each ASCII character requires 7 bits to encode.  This impacts nearly every portion of the Modbus data frame.  Slave address and function code portions, for example, require 14 bits each in ASCII but only 8 bits each in RTU.  The data portion of a Modbus ASCII frame requires one ASCII character (7 bits) to represent each hexadecimal symbol that in turn represents just 4 bits of actual data.  The data portion of a Modbus RTU frame, by contrast, codes the data bits directly (i.e. 8 bits of data appear as 8 bits within that portion of the frame).  Additionally, RTU data frames use quiet periods (pauses) as delimiters, while ASCII data frames use three ASCII characters in total to mark the start and stop of each frame, at a &ldquo;cost&rdquo; of 21 additional bits.  These additional delimiting bits do serve a practical purpose, though: they format each Modbus ASCII data frame as its own line on the screen of a terminal program.

If I wish to rename the executable something more meaningful, I may either do so manually after compilation, or invoke the &ldquo;outfile&rdquo; option of <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">gcc</SPAN> and specify the desired executable filename: (e.g. <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">gcc -o tony.exe tony_modbus -lmodbus</SPAN>).  Once compiled, the executable file many be run and the results of the Modbus query viewed on the computer's display.
