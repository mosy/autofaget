<DD>Even this advantage is not always true.  It is possible to build self-powered thermocouple temperature indicators, where an analog meter movement is driven by the electrical energy a thermocouple sensing junction outputs.  Here, no external electrical power source is required!  However, the accuracy of self-powered thermocouple systems is poor, as is the ability to measure small temperature ranges.

<DD>&ldquo;Swamping&rdquo; is the term given to the overshadowing of one effect by another.  Here, the normal resistance of the thermistor greatly overshadows (&ldquo;swamps&rdquo;) any wire resistance in the circuit, such that wire resistance becomes negligible.

 HREF="node2.html#tex2html5"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">5</SPAN></SUP></A></DT>
<DD>These errors will result only if the paralleled wires carry current.  If the two wires you paralleled happen to join the transmitter's sensing terminal to the RTD (the one carrying no current), no errors will result.  However, many RTD transmitters do not document which of the terminals <SPAN  CLASS="textit">sense</SPAN> (carry no current) versus which of them <SPAN  CLASS="textit">excite</SPAN> (carry current to the RTD), and so there is a probability of getting it wrong if you simply guess.  Given that there is no real benefit to having paralleled wires connecting the transmitter's sensing terminal to the RTD, my advice is to either use all four wires and configure the transmitter for 4-wire mode, or don't use the fourth wire at all.

<DD>The colors in this table apply only to the United States and Canada.  A stunning diversity of colors has been &ldquo;standardized&rdquo; for each thermocouple type per nationality.  The British and Czechs use their own color code, as do the Dutch and Germans.  France has its own unique color code as well.  Just for fun, an &ldquo;international&rdquo; color code also exists which doesn't match any of the others.  There are other deviations as well: the wire colors for type R and S thermocouples, for example, are standardized for <SPAN  CLASS="textit">extension-grade wire</SPAN> but not for <SPAN  CLASS="textit">thermocouple-grade wire</SPAN>.

<DD>It should be noted that no amount of engineering or design is able to <SPAN  CLASS="textit">completely</SPAN> prevent people from doing the wrong thing.  I have seen this style of thermocouple plug forcibly mated the wrong way to a socket.  The amount of insertion force necessary to make the plug fit backward into the socket was quite extraordinary, yet this apparently was not enough of a clue for this wayward individual to give them pause.

<DD>Grounded thermocouples often have thermal time constant values less than <SPAN  CLASS="textit">half</SPAN> that of comparable ungrounded thermocouples.  Exposed-tip thermocouples are even faster than grounded-tip, typically by even larger ratios than grounded-tip thermocouples are to ungrounded thermocouples.

 HREF="node2.html#tex2html12"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">12</SPAN></SUP></A></DT>
<DD>Early texts on thermocouple use describe multiple techniques for automatic compensation of the reference (&ldquo;cold&rdquo;) junction.  One design placed a mercury bulb thermometer at the reference junction, with a loop of thin platinum wire dipped into the mercury.  As junction temperature rose, the mercury column would rise and short past a greater length of the platinum wire loop, causing its resistance to decrease which in turn would electrically bias the measurement circuit to offset the effects of the reference junction's voltage.  Another design used a bi-metallic spring to offset the pointer of the meter movement, so that changes in temperature at the indicating instrument (where the reference junction was located) would result in the analog meter's needle becoming offset from its normal &ldquo;zero&rdquo; point, thus compensating for the offset in voltage created by the reference junction.

 ALT="$_{2}$"></SPAN>O) the temperature of that mixture will be a strict function of pressure, the mixture possessing only one thermodynamic degree of freedom.  Any addition or removal of heat from the ice/water mix results in a phase change (e.g. either more ice melts to become water, or more water freezes to become ice) rather than a temperature change.  If even more precision is desired, a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">triple point cell</SPAN> may be used to fix the reference junction's temperature, since any substance at its triple point will possess zero degrees of thermodynamic freedom (i.e. neither its pressure nor temperature can change).

<DD>Please note that &ldquo;cold junction&rdquo; is just a synonymous label for &ldquo;reference junction.&rdquo;  In fact the &ldquo;cold&rdquo; reference junction may very well be at a warmer temperature than the so-called &ldquo;hot&rdquo; measurement junction!  Nothing prevents anyone from using a thermocouple to measure temperatures below the freezing point of water.

<DD>This is a good application of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">fail-safe design</SPAN>, where we choose the transmitter's failure mode based on the safest outcome.  For example, if our temperature transmitter were being used to sense the temperature of a furnace where excessive temperature was more dangerous than insufficient temperature, we would want to configure it for &ldquo;high&rdquo; burnout.  This way if the thermocouple fails open, the transmitter will report a dangerous (but false) measurement of furnace temperature to the controller, which in turn will automatically act to <SPAN  CLASS="textit">decrease</SPAN> the furnace's actual temperature (i.e. the safer condition.)

 HREF="node2.html#tex2html24"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">24</SPAN></SUP></A></DT>
<DD>Comparing temperature ratios versus thermopile millivoltage ratios assumes linear thermocouple behavior, which we know is not exactly true.  Even if the thermopile focal point temperatures precisely followed the ratios predicted by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, we would still expect some inconsistencies due to the non-linearities of thermocouple voltages.  There will also be variations from predicted values due to shifts in radiated light frequencies, changes in emissivity factor, thermal losses within the sensing head, and other factors that refuse to remain constant over wide ranges of received radiation intensity.  The lesson here is to not expect perfect agreement with theory!

<DD>The air gap acts as a thermal <SPAN  CLASS="textit">resistance</SPAN> while the mass of the element itself acts as a thermal <SPAN  CLASS="textit">capacitance</SPAN>.  Thus, the inclusion of an air gap forms a thermal &ldquo;RC time constant&rdquo; delay network secondary to the thermal delay incurred by the thermowell.  This adds another &ldquo;order&rdquo; of lag to the system, not just an increase in its thermal time constant.  Generally speaking, multiple orders of lag are detrimental to process control because they increase phase shift in a feedback loop and may lead to oscillation.
