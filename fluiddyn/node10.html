Classical mechanics</A>

<P>
Classical mechanics (often called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Newtonian</SPAN> mechanics in honor of Isaac Newton) deal with forces and motions of objects in common circumstances.  The vast majority of instrumentation applications deals with this realm of physics.  Two other areas of physics, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">relativistic</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">quantum</SPAN>, will not be covered in this chapter because their domains lie outside the typical experience of industrial instrumentation<A ID="tex2html7"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot448"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">7</SPAN></SUP></A>.

<H2><A ID="SECTION00281000000000000000">
Newton's Laws of Motion</A>
</H2>

<P>
These laws were formulated by the great mathematician and physicist Isaac Newton (1642-1727).  Much of Newton's thought was inspired by the work of an individual who died the same year Newton was born, Galileo Galilei (1564-1642).  <A NAME="450"></A> <A NAME="451"></A>

<P>

<OL>
<LI>An object at rest tends to stay at rest; an object in motion tends to stay in motion
</LI>
<LI>The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting upon it and inversely proportional to the object's mass
</LI>
<LI>Forces between objects always exist in equal and opposite pairs
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Newton's first law</SPAN> may be thought of as the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">law of inertia</SPAN>, because it describes the property of inertia that all objects having mass exhibit: resistance to change in velocity.  This law is quite counter-intuitive for many people, who tend to believe that objects require continual force to keep moving.  While this is true for objects experiencing friction, it is not for ideal (frictionless) motion.  This is why satellites and other objects in space continue to travel with no mode of propulsion: they simply &ldquo;coast&rdquo; indefinitely on their own inertia because there is no friction in space to dissipate their kinetic energy and slow them down.  <A NAME="456"></A>

<P>
<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Newton's second law</SPAN> is the verbal equivalent of the force/mass/acceleration formula: <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.77ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img83.svg"
 ALT="$F = ma$"></SPAN>.  This law elaborates on the first, in that it mathematically relates force and motion in a very precise way.  For a frictionless object, the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">change in velocity</SPAN> (i.e. its <SPAN  CLASS="textit">acceleration</SPAN>) is proportional to force.  This is why a frictionless object may continue to move without any force applied: once moving, force would only be necessary for continued acceleration.  If zero force is applied, the acceleration will likewise be zero, and the object will maintain its velocity indefinitely (again, assuming no friction at work). <A NAME="460"></A>

<P>
<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Newton's third law</SPAN> describes how forces always exist in <SPAN  CLASS="textit">pairs</SPAN> between two objects.  The rotating blades of a helicopter, for example, exert a downward force on the air (accelerating the air), but the air in turn exerts an upward force on the helicopter (suspending it in flight).  A spider hanging on the end of a thread exerts a downward force (weight) on the thread, while the thread exerts an upward force of equal magnitude on the spider (tension).  Force pairs are always equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.  <A NAME="463"></A>

<P>
Two very fundamental and closely-related concepts in physics are <SPAN  CLASS="textit">work</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">energy</SPAN>.  <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Work</SPAN> is simply what happens when any force acts through a parallel motion, such as when a weight is lifted against gravity or when a spring is compressed.  <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Energy</SPAN> is a more abstract concept and therefore more difficult to define.  One definition<A ID="tex2html8"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot2351"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">8</SPAN></SUP></A> of energy is &ldquo;that which permits or results in motion,&rdquo; where the word &ldquo;motion&rdquo; is used in a very broad sense including even the motion of individual atoms within a substance.  Energy exists in many different forms, and may be transferred between objects and/or converted from one form to another, but cannot be created from nothing or be destroyed and turned into nothing (this is the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Law of Energy Conservation</SPAN>).  <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Power</SPAN> is the rate at which work is done, or alternatively the rate at which energy transfer occurs.  <A NAME="475"></A>  <A NAME="476"></A>  <A NAME="477"></A>  <A NAME="478"></A>  <A NAME="479"></A>  <A NAME="480"></A>

<P>
First, just a little bit of math.  Work (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.77ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img85.svg"
 ALT="$W$"></SPAN>) is mathematically defined as the dot-product of force (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.77ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img3.svg"

<P>
The fact that both force and displacement appear as <SPAN  CLASS="textit">vectors</SPAN> tells us their relative directions are significant to the calculation of work.  If the force and displacement vectors point in exactly the same direction, work is simply the product of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.77ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img3.svg"

<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.70ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img95.svg"
 ALT="$\cos 0^{o} = 1$"></SPAN>.  When the two vectors point in opposite directions, the angle between them is 180<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.70ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img49.svg"

<P>
This means if a force acts in the same direction as a motion (i.e. force and displacement vectors pointing in the same direction), the work being done by that force will be a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">positive</SPAN> quantity.  If a force acts in the opposite direction of a motion (i.e. force and displacement vectors pointing in opposite directions), the work done by that force will be a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">negative</SPAN> quantity.  If a force acts perpendicularly to the direction of a motion (i.e. force and displacement vectors at right angles to each other), that force will do <SPAN  CLASS="textit">zero</SPAN> work.

Illustrations are helpful in explaining these concepts.  Consider a crane hoisting a 2380 pound weight 15 feet up into the air by means of an attached cable:

The amount of work done from the crane's perspective is <!-- MATH
 $W_{crane} = +35700$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 2.12ex; vertical-align: -0.45ex; " SRC="img99.svg"
 ALT="$W_{crane} = +35700$"></SPAN> ft-lbs, since the crane's force (<!-- MATH
 $F_{crane} =$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 2.12ex; vertical-align: -0.45ex; " SRC="img100.svg"
 ALT="$F_{crane} =$"></SPAN> 2380 lbs, up) points in the same upward direction as the cable's motion (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.19ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img101.svg"
 ALT="$x =$"></SPAN> 15 ft, up) and therefore there is no angular difference between the crane force and motion vectors (i.e. <!-- MATH
 $\theta = 0$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.80ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img102.svg"
 ALT="$\theta = 0$"></SPAN>).  The amount of work done from weight's perspective, however, is <!-- MATH
 $W_{weight} = -35700$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 2.42ex; vertical-align: -0.75ex; " SRC="img103.svg"
 ALT="$W_{weight} = -35700$"></SPAN> ft-lbs because the weight's force vector (<!-- MATH
 $F_{weight} =$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 2.42ex; vertical-align: -0.75ex; " SRC="img104.svg"
 ALT="$F_{weight} =$"></SPAN> 2380 lbs, down) points in the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">opposite</SPAN> direction as the cable's motion vector (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.19ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img101.svg"
 ALT="$x =$"></SPAN> 15 feet, up), yielding an angular difference of <!-- MATH
 $\theta = 180^o$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.80ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img105.svg"
 ALT="$\theta = 180^o$"></SPAN>.  Another way of expressing these two work values is to state the crane's work in the active voice and the weight's work in the passive voice: <SPAN  CLASS="textit">the crane <SPAN ID="txt505">did</SPAN> 35700 ft-lbs of work, while 35700 ft-lbs of work <SPAN ID="txt506">was done on</SPAN> the weight</SPAN>.  This language is truly appropriate, as the crane is indeed the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">active</SPAN> agent in this scenario, while the weight <SPAN  CLASS="textit">passively opposes</SPAN> the crane's efforts.  In other words, the crane is the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">motive source</SPAN> of the work, while the weight is a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">load</SPAN>.

<P>
Now, how does <SPAN  CLASS="textit">energy</SPAN> fit into this illustration?  Certainly we see that motion occurred, and therefore energy must have been involved.  The energy lifting the 2380 pound weight 15 feet upward didn't come from nowhere &ndash; it must have been present somewhere in the universe prior to the weight's ascension if the Law of Energy Conservation is indeed true.  If the crane is powered by an internal combustion engine, the energy came from the fuel stored in the crane's fuel tank.  If the crane is electric, the energy to hoist the weight came from a battery or from an electrical generator somewhere sending power to the crane through an electric cable.  The act of lifting the weight was actually an act of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">energy transfer</SPAN> from the crane's energy source, through the crane motor and cable, and finally to the weight.  Along the way, some of the initial energy was also converted into heat through inefficiencies in the crane's motor and mechanism.  However, if we were to calculate the sum of all the energy transferred to the lifted weight plus all energy &ldquo;dissipated&rdquo; in the form of heat, that total must be precisely equal to the initial energy of the fuel (or electricity) used by the crane in doing this lift.  In other words, the sum total of all energy in the universe is the same after the lift as it was before the lift.

<P>
<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Power</SPAN> applies in this scenario to how <SPAN  CLASS="textit">quickly</SPAN> the weight rises.  So far, all we know about the weight's lifting is that it took 35700 ft-lbs of energy to do that work.  If we knew how long it took the crane to do that work, we could calculate the crane's power output.  For example, a crane with a power rating of 35700 ft-lbs per second could complete this 15-foot lift in only one second of time.  Likewise, a crane with a power rating of only 3570 ft-lbs per second would require 10 seconds of time to execute the same lift.

<P>

<P>
An interesting thing happens if the crane moves sideways along the ground after lifting the weight 15 feet up into the air.  No work is being done by the crane on the weight, or by the weight on the crane, because the displacement vector is now perpendicular (<!-- MATH
 $\theta = 90^o$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.80ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img106.svg"
 ALT="$\theta = 90^o$"></SPAN>) to both force vectors:

<P>

</P>
<DIV CLASS="displaymath">
<IMG STYLE="height: 30.77ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img107.svg"
 ALT="$\displaystyle \includegraphics{energy_09.eps}$">
</DIV><P></P>

<P>
It should be noted that the crane's engine <SPAN  CLASS="textit">will</SPAN> do work as it overcomes rolling friction in the wheels to move the crane along, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">but this is not work done on or by the hoisted weight</SPAN>.  When we calculate work &ndash; as with all other calculations in physics &ndash; we must be very careful to keep in mind where the calculation(s) apply in the scenario.  Here, the forces and displacement with regard to the hoisted weight are perpendicular to each other, and therefore no work is being done there.  The only work done anywhere in this system as the crane rolls 15 feet horizontally involves the horizontal force required to roll the crane, which is unspecified in this illustration.

<P>
Similarly, there is no transfer of energy to or from the hoisted weight while the crane rolls along.  Whatever energy comes through the crane's engine only goes into overcoming rolling friction at the wheels and ground, not to do any work with the weight itself.  Generally this will be a very small amount of energy compared to the energy required to hoist a heavy load.

<P>

<P>
A good question to ask after hoisting the weight is &ldquo;Where did that 35700 ft-lbs of energy go after the lift was complete?&rdquo;  The Law of Energy Conservation tells us that energy cannot be destroyed, and so the 35700 ft-lbs of work must be accounted for somehow.  In this case, the energy is now <SPAN  CLASS="textit">stored</SPAN> in the weight where it may be released at some later time.  We may demonstrate this fact by slowly lowering the weight back down to the ground and watching the energy transfer:

<P>
<P><!-- MATH
 \begin{displaymath}
\includegraphics{energy_07.eps}
\end{displaymath}
 -->
</P>
<DIV CLASS="displaymath">
<IMG STYLE="height: 30.77ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img108.svg"
 ALT="$\displaystyle \includegraphics{energy_07.eps}$">
</DIV><P></P>

<P>
Notice how the weight is now the actively-working object in the system, doing work on the crane.  The crane is now the passive element, opposing the work being done by the weight.  Both the crane and the weight are still pulling the same directions as before (crane pulling up, weight pulling down), but now the direction of displacement is going down which means the weight is &ldquo;winning&rdquo; and therefore doing the work, while the crane is &ldquo;losing&rdquo; and opposing the work.

<P>
If we examine what is happening inside the crane as the weight descends, we see that energy is being transferred from the descending weight to the crane.  In most cranes, the descent of a load is controlled by a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">brake</SPAN> mechanism, regulating the speed of descent by applying friction to the cable's motion.  This brake friction generates a great deal of heat, which is a form of energy transfer: energy stored in the elevated weight is now being converted into heat which exits the crane in the form of hot air (air whose molecules are now vibrating at a faster speed than they were at their previous temperature).  If the crane is electric, we have the option of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">regenerative braking</SPAN> where we recapture this energy instead of dissipating it in the form of heat.  This works by switching the crane's electric motor into an electric generator on demand, so the weight's descent turns the motor/generator shaft to generate electricity to re-charge the crane's battery or be injected back into the electric power grid to do useful work elsewhere.

<P>
<P>

<P>
Referring back to the illustration of the crane hoisting the weight, it is clear that the weight stored energy while it was being lifted up by the crane, and released this energy back to the crane while it was being lowered down to the ground.  The energy held by the elevated weight may therefore be characterized as <SPAN  CLASS="textit">potential energy</SPAN>, since it had the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">potential</SPAN> to do work even if no work was being done by that energy at that moment.  <A NAME="524"></A>  <A NAME="525"></A>

A special version of the general work formula <!-- MATH

Many different forms of potential energy exist, although the standard &ldquo;textbook&rdquo; example is of a mass lifted to some height against the force of gravity.  Compressed (or stretched) springs have potential energy, as do pressurized fluids, chemical bonds (e.g. fuel molecules prior to combustion), hot masses, electrically-charged capacitors, and magnetized inductors.

An important application of work, energy, and power is found in <SPAN  CLASS="textit">rotational</SPAN> motion.  Consider the application of a truck towing some load by a rope.  The truck exerts a linear (i.e. straight-line) pulling force on the load being towed, but it must do so by applying a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">rotary</SPAN> (i.e. turning) force through the axle shaft powering the drive wheels:

For the sake of this example, it matters not what happens to the energy delivered to the load.  Perhaps it gets converted to heat through the mechanism of friction at the load (e.g. friction from road contact, friction from wind resistance), perhaps it gets converted into potential energy in the case of the road inclining to a greater altitude, or perhaps (most likely) it is some combination of all these.

In order to quantify this amount of work from the perspective of the truck's rotating wheel, we must cast the variables of pulling force and pulling distance into rotary terms.  We will begin by first examining the distance traveled by the wheel.  Any circular wheel has a radius, and the wheel must turn a certain number of revolutions in order to pull the load any distance.  The obvious function of a wheel is to convert between linear and rotary motion, and the common measure between these two motions is the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">circumference</SPAN> of the wheel: each revolution of the wheel equates directly to one circumference's worth of linear travel.  In our truck example, the wheel has a radius of 1.5 feet, which means it must have a circumference of 9.425 feet (i.e. <!-- MATH
 $2 \times \pi \times 1.5$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.88ex; vertical-align: -0.29ex; " SRC="img123.svg"

 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.77ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img124.svg"
 ALT="$C = \pi D = 2 \pi r$"></SPAN>).  Therefore, in order to travel 40 linear feet this wheel must rotate 4.244 times (i.e. 40 feet <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.74ex; vertical-align: -0.29ex; " SRC="img125.svg"
 ALT="$\div$"></SPAN> 9.425 feet/revolution = 4.244 revolutions).

<P>
Next, we must relate pulling force to rotational force.  The 1200 pounds of pulling force exerted by the wheel<A ID="tex2html10"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot2354"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">10</SPAN></SUP></A> originates from the twisting force exerted by the axle at the wheel's center.  The technical term for this twisting force is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">torque</SPAN> (symbolized by the Greek letter &ldquo;tau&rdquo;, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.19ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img126.svg"

<P>
Solving for torque (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.19ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img126.svg"
 ALT="$\tau$"></SPAN>) in this application, we calculate 1800 pound-feet given the wheel's linear pulling force of 1200 pounds and a radius of 1.5 feet.  Please note that the unit of &ldquo;pound-feet&rdquo; for torque is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">not</SPAN> the same as the unit of &ldquo;foot-pounds&rdquo; for work.  Work is the product of force and displacement (distance of motion), while torque is the product of force and radius length.  Work requires motion, while torque does not<A ID="tex2html11"

<P>
The torque value of 1800 lb-ft and the turning of 4.244 revolutions should be sufficient to calculate work done by the wheel, since torque equates directly to pulling force and the number of revolutions equates directly to pulling distance.  It should be obvious that the product of 1800 lb-ft and 4.244 revolutions does not, however, equal 48000 ft-lbs of work, and so our torque-revolutions-work formula must contain an additional multiplication factor <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.80ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img63.svg"

This formula is correct no matter the wheel's size.  A larger-radius wheel will certainly travel farther for each revolution, but that larger radius will proportionately reduce the pulling force for any given amount of torque, resulting in an unchanged work value.

Applying this work formula to another application, let us consider an electric <SPAN  CLASS="textit">winch</SPAN> where a load is lifted against the force of gravity.  A &ldquo;winch&rdquo; is a mechanism comprised of a tubular drum and cable, the cable wrapping or unwrapping around the drum as the drum is turned by an electric motor.  For comparison we will use the same weight and lifting distance of the crane example, merely replacing the crane with a winch located atop a tower.  In this case we will make the winch drum 3 inches in diameter, and calculate both the torque required to rotate the drum as well as the number of rotations necessary to lift the weight 15 feet:  <A NAME="556"></A>

As always, energy is conserved in this electric winch system just as it is in any other system.  The 35700 foot-pounds of energy invested in the gravitational potential energy of the weight had to originate from somewhere, which in the case of an electric winch is the electrical power source feeding the winch motor.  If that winch motor were allowed to turn in reverse and act as a generator, it would convert the descending weight's loss in potential energy into electrical power to be returned to the source, whether that source by a rechargeable battery or an electrical power &ldquo;grid&rdquo; with other electrical loads that may use that energy.

<P>
The same, of course, is true for the tow truck example.  The energy expended in towing the load must come from somewhere, and in the case of a combustion-type truck engine that source is the fuel powering the engine.  For electric vehicles, the energy source is a rechargeable battery, and the reversible nature of electric motors means the vehicle may use its drive motor as a generator to &ldquo;brake&rdquo; (slow down), returning the vehicle's kinetic energy into electrical energy to recharge the battery for later use.  This is why all-electric and hybrid-electric vehicles are remarkably efficient in stop-and-go traffic conditions: they utilize their drive motors as <SPAN  CLASS="textit">regenerative brakes</SPAN> to recover the vehicle's kinetic energy rather than dissipating that same energy in the form of heat using friction-based brake mechanisms.

Many applications exist within the industrial world for rotational work and electric motors.  Conveyor belts, pumps, fans, compressors, and a host of other mechanisms may be powered via electric motors, the speed and torque of those electric motors controlled using electronic circuits called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">motor drives</SPAN>.  Alternating-current (AC) electric motors are controlled by electronic devices called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Variable Frequency Drives</SPAN>, or <SPAN  CLASS="textit">VFDs</SPAN>, which achieve precise speed control by varying the frequency of the AC power feeding the motor, and achieve precise torque control by varying the voltage and current feeding the motor.  VFDs are very important &ldquo;final control&rdquo; devices used in a wide variety of industrial control systems.  <A NAME="571"></A>  <A NAME="572"></A>  <A NAME="573"></A>  <A NAME="574"></A>

Potential energy is an important principle not just in the study of physics, but also for workplace safety.  When large amounts of potential energy are released, the effects may be hazardous to personnel and/or destructive to equipment.  An industrial maintenance procedure known as <SPAN  CLASS="textit">lock-out/tag-out</SPAN> (LOTO) requires that all potential energy sources on a system must either be exhausted or otherwise secured to that there will be negligible risk to maintenance personnel as they perform work on a system.  The most common way to ensure this is to place a padlock on each energy-disconnect device (e.g. switch, valve, etc.) to secure its position so that potential energy cannot be released in a hazardous or destructive way.  Each maintenance worker places a padlock on that disconnect device to prevent its actuation, and also places a tag on the device explaining when and why it was secured.  Each and every person performing work on the system must use their own personal padlock, so that the system cannot be re-activated without the active consent of all persons working on that system.  <A NAME="577"></A>   <A NAME="578"></A> 

<P>
An efficient strategy for safely locking out a large number of safety-disconnect devices on a system with multiple personal locks is to use a sheet-metal box containing a numbered padlock (with matching key) for each energy-flow device to be secured on the equipment, as well as a list identifying which lock goes on which energy-flow device.  Each energy-disconnect device is placed in the safe position and then locked in that position with a dedicated padlock.  After that, all the padlock keys are placed back inside the sheet-metal box.  The lid of this box is then shut and secured with a multi-lock device, permitting multiple peoples' personal locks to be applied so the lid cannot be opened unless <SPAN  CLASS="textit">all</SPAN> personal locks are removed from it:

Note the particular lock-out steps required in this procedure: switching the control mode to the &ldquo;off&rdquo; position and tagging it, closing the fuel gas valve supplying fuel to the engine and locking/tagging it, and finally closing the valve supplying high-pressure air for engine starting and locking/tagging it.  The closure of the starting air valve prevents the engine from being pneumatically turned while personnel are performing work on it.  The closure of the fuel gas valve eliminates hazards resulting from the pressure of the fuel gas as well as its chemical energy (i.e. fire hazard) and/or biological threats (poisoning or asphyxiation).

Let us return to the crane illustration to explore another concept called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">kinetic energy</SPAN>.  As you might guess by the word &ldquo;kinetic,&rdquo; this form of energy exists when an object is in the process of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">moving</SPAN>.  Let's imagine the crane lifting the 2380 pound weight 15 feet up into the air, and then the cable snapping apart so that the weight free-falls back to the ground:  <A NAME="596"></A>  <A NAME="597"></A>

The Conservation of Energy still (and always!) holds true: all the potential energy stored in the elevated weight must be accounted for, even when it free-falls.  What happens, of course, is that the weight accelerates toward the ground at the rate determined by Earth's gravity: 32.2 feet per second per second (32.2 ft/s<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 2.03ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img18.svg"

 ALT="$E_p = mgh$"></SPAN>), but since we know energy cannot simply disappear we must conclude it is taking some other form.

<P>
Thus, the Conservation of Energy explains why a falling object must fall faster as it loses height: kinetic energy must increase by the same amount that potential energy decreases, if energy is to be conserved.  A very small amount of this falling weight's potential energy will be dissipated in the form of heat (as air molecules are disturbed) rather than get converted into kinetic energy.  However, the vast majority of the initial 35700 ft-lbs of potential energy gets converted into kinetic energy, until the weight's energy is all kinetic and no potential the moment it first touches the ground.

<P>
When the weight finally slams into the ground, all that (nearly 35700 ft-lbs) of kinetic energy once again gets converted into other forms.  Compression of the soil upon impact converts much of the energy into heat (molecular vibrations).  Chunks of soil ejected from the impact zone possess their own kinetic energy, carrying that energy to other locations where they slam into other stationary objects.  Sound waves rippling through the air also convey energy away from the point of impact.  All in all, the 35700 ft-lbs of potential energy which turned into (nearly) 35700 ft-lbs of kinetic energy at ground level becomes dispersed.

The Law of Energy Conservation is extremely useful in projectile mechanics problems, where we typically assume a projectile loses no energy and gains no energy in its flight.  The velocity of a projectile, therefore, depends on its height above the ground, because the sum of potential and kinetic energies must remain constant:  <A NAME="602"></A> <A NAME="603"></A>

As a projectile rises in altitude (i.e. its gravitational potential energy increases), its velocity must slow down (i.e. its kinetic energy decreases) in order that its total energy remain the same in accordance with the Law of Energy Conservation.

Hooke's Law is a linear function, just like Ohm's Law is a linear function: doubling the displacement (either tension or compression) doubles the spring's force.  At least this is how springs behave when they are displaced a small percentage of their total length.  If you stretch or compress a spring more substantially, the spring's material will become strained beyond its elastic limit and either yield (permanently deform) or fail (break).

<P>
The amount of potential energy stored in a tensed spring may be predicted using calculus.  We know that potential energy stored in a spring is the same as the amount of work done on the spring, and work is equal to the product of force and displacement (assuming parallel lines of action for both):

With the radius and force vectors at right angles to each other, torque is simply the product of both.  In many non-academic settings, torque is calculated this way as a scalar quantity, with the direction of rotation determined by observation rather than by strict adherence to the right-hand rule of vector cross products.  In this example, we see the magnitude of torque as the simple product of 58 pounds force and 0.61 feet of moment arm (35.38 lb-ft of torque), with the torque direction obviously counter-clockwise as viewed from the head of the bolt.

If we apply the same force to the wrench handle at a different angle (not perpendicular to the handle), the resulting torque will be less.  The radius vector (moment arm), however, will still remain perpendicular to the force vector (line of action) &ndash; it just decreases in length.  To determine the placement of the radius vector, all one must do is draw a line straight from the axis of rotation perpendicular to the line of action, then use trigonometry to calculate its magnitude:

Each gear effectively acts as a wheel, the point of contact between gear teeth acting to transfer force perpendicular to the radius of each gear (wheel).

For example, if a small gear having 28 teeth meshes with a larger gear having 75 teeth, the torque multiplication factor from the small gear to the large gear will be 75:28, or 2.679 to 1.  A torque of 40 lb-ft applied to the small gear will result in a torque of 107.1 lb-ft or torque generated at the large gear.  This ratio of gear teeth is called the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">gear ratio</SPAN>.  <A NAME="692"></A>

<P>
As gears multiply torque (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.19ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img126.svg"
 ALT="$\tau$"></SPAN>), they divide rotational speed (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.19ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img179.svg"
 ALT="$\omega$"></SPAN>).  Thus, the 75:28 tooth gear set creates a multiplication of torque from the small gear to the large gear, and an identical <SPAN  CLASS="textit">reduction ratio</SPAN> of speed from the small gear to the large gear.  Given this ratio, the small gear will have to be turned 2.679 revolutions in order to make the large gear turn just one revolution.

<P>
We may express gear speeds as another ratio of gear teeth, reciprocated in relation to torque:

In a set of meshed gears, the smaller gear will have the least torque and the greatest speed; the larger gear will have the greatest torque and the least speed.

<P>
This is precisely how gear sets are used in industry: to transform torque and speed in mechanical power systems.  The complementary effects of a gear set on torque and speed is analogous to the complementary effects that a transformer has on AC voltage and current: a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">step-up transformer</SPAN> (having more turns of wire in the secondary coil than in the primary coil) will multiply voltage but reduce (divide) current, both by the same turns ratio.  <A NAME="697"></A>

Every quantity of force and motion which may be expressed in linear form has a rotational equivalent.  As we have seen, torque (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.19ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img126.svg"

Familiar equations for linear motion have rotational equivalents as well.  For example, Newton's Second Law of motion states, &ldquo;The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting upon it and inversely proportional to the object's mass.&rdquo;  We may modify this law for rotational motion by saying, &ldquo;The angular acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net torque acting upon it and inversely proportional to the object's moment of inertia.&rdquo;  The mathematical expressions of both forms of Newton's Second Law are as follows:  <A NAME="718"></A>

An object's &ldquo;moment of inertia&rdquo; represents its angular inertia (opposition to changes in rotational velocity), and is proportional to the object's mass and to the square of its radius.  Two objects having the same mass will have different moments of inertia if there is a difference in the distribution of their mass relative to radius.  Thus, a hollow tube will have a greater moment of inertia than a solid rod of equal mass, assuming an axis of rotation in the center of the tube/rod length:
