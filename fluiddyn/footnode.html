<DD>An interesting point to make here is the United States did get something right when they designed their monetary system of dollars and cents.  This is essentially a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">metric</SPAN> system of measurement, with 100 cents per dollar.  The founders of the USA wisely decided to avoid the utterly confusing denominations of the British, with their pounds, pence, farthings, shillings, etc.  The denominations of penny, dime, dollar, and eagle ($10 gold coin) comprised a simple power-of-ten system for money.  Credit goes to France for first adopting a metric system of general weights and measures as their national standard.

<DD>A basic mathematical identity is that multiplication of any quantity by 1 does not change the value of that original quantity.  If we multiply some quantity by a fraction having a physical value of 1, no matter how strange-looking that fraction may appear, the value of the original quantity will be left intact.  The goal here is to judiciously choose a fraction with a physical value of 1 but with its units of measurement so arranged that we cancel out the original quantity's unit(s) and replace them with the units we desire.

 HREF="node10.html#tex2html8"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">8</SPAN></SUP></A></DT>
<DD>A common definition of energy is the &ldquo;ability to do work&rdquo; which is not always true.  There are some forms of energy which may <SPAN  CLASS="textit">not</SPAN> be harnessed to do work, such as the thermal motion of molecules in an environment where all objects are at the same temperature.  Energy that has the ability to do work is more specifically referred to as <SPAN  CLASS="textit">exergy</SPAN>.  While energy is always conserved (i.e. never lost, never gained), exergy is a quantity that can never be gained but can be lost.  The inevitable loss of exergy is closely related to the concept of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">entropy</SPAN>, where energy naturally diffuses into less useful (more homogeneous) forms over time.  This important concept explains why no machine can never be perfectly (<!-- MATH

<DD>A <SPAN  CLASS="textit">vector</SPAN> is a mathematical quantity possessing both a magnitude and a direction.  Force (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.77ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img3.svg"
 ALT="$F$"></SPAN>), displacement (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.19ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img12.svg"
 ALT="$x$"></SPAN>), and velocity (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.19ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img9.svg"
 ALT="$v$"></SPAN>) are all vector quantities.  Some physical quantities such as temperature (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.77ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img86.svg"
 ALT="$T$"></SPAN>), work (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.77ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img85.svg"
 ALT="$W$"></SPAN>), and energy (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.77ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img81.svg"
 ALT="$E$"></SPAN>) possess magnitude but no direction.  We call these directionless quantities &ldquo;scalar.&rdquo;  It would make no sense at all to speak of a temperature being &ldquo;79 degrees Celsius due North&rdquo; whereas it <SPAN  CLASS="textit">would</SPAN> make sense to speak of a force being &ldquo;79 Newtons due North&rdquo;.  Physicists commonly use a little arrow symbol over the variable letter to represent that variable as a vector, when both magnitude and direction matter.  Thus <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 2.43ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img87.svg"
 ALT="$\vec{F}$"></SPAN> represents a force vector with both magnitude and direction specified, while plain <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.77ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img3.svg"
 ALT="$F$"></SPAN> merely represents the magnitude of that force without a specified direction.  A &ldquo;dot-product&rdquo; is one way in which vectors may be multiplied, and the result of a dot-product is always a scalar quantity.

<DD>Note that this calculation will assume all the work of towing this load is being performed by a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">single</SPAN> wheel on the truck.  Most likely this will not be the case, as most towing vehicles have multiple driving wheels (at least two).  However, we will perform calculations for a single wheel in order to simplify the problem.

 HREF="node10.html#tex2html12"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">12</SPAN></SUP></A></DT>
<DD>In practice, we usually see heavy objects fall faster than light objects due to the resistance of air.  Energy losses due to air friction nullify our assumption of constant total energy during free-fall.  Energy lost due to air friction never translates to velocity, and so the heavier object ends up hitting the ground faster (and sooner) because it had much more energy than the light object did to start.

 ALT="$F$"></SPAN>) is the force <SPAN  CLASS="textit">applied</SPAN> on the spring from an external source.  Here, the negative sign represents the spring's reaction force to being displaced (the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">restoring</SPAN> force).  A spring's reaction force always opposes the direction of displacement: compress a spring, and it pushes back on you; stretch a spring, and it pulls back.  A negative sign is the mathematically symbolic way of expressing the opposing direction of a vector.

<DD>A &ldquo;flywheel&rdquo; is a disk on a shaft, designed to maintain rotary motion in the absence of a motivating torque for the function of machines such as piston engines.  The rotational kinetic energy stored by an engine's flywheel is necessary to give the pistons energy to compress the gas prior to the power stroke, during the times the other pistons are not producing power.

<DT><A ID="foot2364">... advantage</A><A
 HREF="node11.html#tex2html16"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">16</SPAN></SUP></A></DT>
<DD>Technically, mechanical advantage should be defined by the ratio of input <SPAN  CLASS="textit">motion</SPAN> to output <SPAN  CLASS="textit">motion</SPAN>, rather than being defined in terms of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">force</SPAN>.  The reason for this is if friction happens to exist in the machine, it will cause a degradation of force but not of motion.  Since &ldquo;mechanical advantage&rdquo; is supposed to represent the ideal ratio of the machine, it is always safest to define it in terms of motion where friction will not affect the calculation.  For a frictionless machine, however, defining mechanical advantage in terms of force is perfectly legitimate, and in fact makes more intuitive sense, since a larger mechanical advantage always corresponds with force multiplication from input to output.

<DD>An interesting feature of many flat-belt sheaves is a slight &ldquo;crown&rdquo; shape to the sheave, such that the diameter is slightly larger at the sheave's center than it is at either side edge.  The purpose of this crown is to help the belt center itself while in operation.  As it turns out, a flat belt naturally tends to find the point at which it operates under maximum tension.  If the belt happens to wander off-center, it will naturally find its way back to the center of the sheave as it rotates because that is where the tension reaches a maximum.

<DD>Heat may be forced to flow from cold to hot by the use of a machine called a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">heat pump</SPAN>, but this direction of heat flow does not happen naturally, which is what the word &ldquo;spontaneous&rdquo; implies.  In truth, the rule of heat flowing from high-temperature to cold-temperature applies to heat pumps as well, just in a way that is not obvious from first inspection.  Mechanical heat pumps cause heat to be drawn from a cool object by placing an even cooler object (the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">evaporator</SPAN>) in direct contact with it.  That heat is then transferred to a hot object by placing an even hotter object (the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">condenser</SPAN>) in direct contact with it.  Heat is moved against the natural (spontaneous) direction of flow from the evaporator to the condenser by means of mechanical compression and expansion of a refrigerant fluid.

<DD>Jim Cahill of Emerson wrote in April 2010 (&ldquo;Reducing Distillation Column Energy Usage&rdquo; Emerson Process Expert weblog) about a report estimating distillation column energy usage to account for approximately 6% of the total energy used in the United States.  This same report tallied the number of columns in US industry to be approximately 40000 total, accounting for about 19% of all energy used in manufacturing processes!

<DD>An important detail to note is that specific heat does <SPAN  CLASS="textit">not</SPAN> remain constant over wide temperature changes.  This complicates calculations of heat required to change the temperature of a sample: instead of simply multiplying the temperature change by mass and specific heat (<!-- MATH
 $Q = mc \Delta T$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 2.22ex; vertical-align: -0.55ex; " SRC="img275.svg"

 $Q = mc [T_2 - T_1]$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 2.51ex; vertical-align: -0.68ex; " SRC="img276.svg"
 ALT="$Q = mc [T_2 - T_1]$"></SPAN>), we must <SPAN  CLASS="textit">integrate</SPAN> specific heat over the range of temperature (<!-- MATH
 $Q = m \int_{T_1}^{T_2} c \> dT$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 3.52ex; vertical-align: -1.12ex; " SRC="img277.svg"
 ALT="$Q = m \int_{T_1}^{T_2} c \&gt; dT$"></SPAN>), summing up infinitesimal products of specific heat and temperature change (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.80ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img278.svg"

 ALT="$T_1$"></SPAN> through temperature <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 2.12ex; vertical-align: -0.45ex; " SRC="img280.svg"
 ALT="$T_2$"></SPAN> then multiplying by the mass to calculate total heat required.  So, the specific heat values given for substances at 25 <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.70ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img49.svg"

<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 2.22ex; vertical-align: -0.55ex; " SRC="img292.svg"

<DD>A useful analogy for enthalpy is the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">maximum available balance</SPAN> of a bank account.  Suppose you have a bank account with a minimum balance requirement of $32 to maintain that account.  Your maximum available balance at any time would be the total amount of money in that account minus $32, or to phrase this differently your maximum available balance is the most money you may spend from this account while still keeping that account open.  Enthalpy is much the same: the amount of thermal energy a sample may &ldquo;spend&rdquo; (i.e. lose) before its temperature reaches 32 degrees Fahrenheit.

<DD>The mechanism of this influence may be understood by considering what it means to boil a liquid into a vapor.  Molecules in a liquid reside close enough to each other that they cohere, whereas molecules in a vapor or gas are relatively far apart and act as independent objects.  The process of boiling requires that cohesion between liquid molecules to be broken, so the molecules may drift apart.  Increased pressure encourages cohesion in liquid form by helping to hold the molecules together, while decreased pressure encourages the separation of molecules into a vapor/gas.

<DD>This is another example of an important thermodynamic concept: the distinction between <SPAN  CLASS="textit">heat</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">temperature</SPAN>.  While the temperature of the pressurizer heating elements exceeds that of the reactor core, the total heat output of course does not.  Typical comparative values for pressurizer power versus reactor core power are 1800 kW versus 3800 MW, respectively: a ratio exceeding three orders of magnitude.  The pressurizer heating elements don't have to dissipate much power (compared to the reactor core) because the pressurizer is not being cooled by a forced convection of water like the reactor core is.

A great many engineering manuals contain steam tables, and in fact entire books exist devoted to nothing but steam tables.

<DD>An experiment illustrative of this point is to maintain an ice-water mixture in an open container, then to insert a sealed balloon containing liquid water into this mixture.  The water inside the balloon will eventually equalize in temperature with the surrounding ice-water mix, but it will not itself freeze.  Once the balloon's water reaches 0 degrees Celsius, it stops losing heat to the surrounding ice-water mix, and therefore cannot make the phase change to solid form.

<DD>Interestingly, the amount of pressure generated by the weight of a fluid depends only on the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">height</SPAN> of that fluid column, not its cross-sectional area.  Suppose we had a column of water the same height (144 feet) but in a tube having an area twice as large: 2 square inches instead of 1 square inch.  Twice the area means twice the volume of water held in the tube, and therefore twice the weight (124.8 lbs).  However, since this greater weight is distributed over a proportionately greater area at the bottom of the tube, the pressure there remains the same as before: 124.8 pounds <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.74ex; vertical-align: -0.29ex; " SRC="img125.svg"

However, sometimes the specific gravity of a liquid will be expressed in relation to the density of water at some other temperature.  In some cases specific gravity is expressed for a liquid at one temperature compared to water at another temperature, usually in the form of a superscript such as 20/4 (liquid at 20 degrees Celsius compared to water at 4 degrees Celsius).

<DD>To give some perspective on just how little the liquid level changes in the well, consider a well-type manometer with a 1/4 inch (inside) diameter viewing tube and a 4-inch diameter circular well.  The ratio of diameters for these two liquid columns is 16:1, which means their ratio of areas is 256:1.  Thus, for every inch of liquid motion in the viewing tube, the liquid inside the well moves <SPAN  CLASS="textit">only <!-- MATH
 $1 \over 256$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 2.90ex; vertical-align: -0.90ex; " SRC="img374.svg"
 ALT="$1 \over 256$"></SPAN> of an inch</SPAN>.  Unless the viewing tube is quite tall, the amount of error incurred by interpreting the tube's liquid height directly as pressure will be minimal &ndash; quite likely less than what the human eye is able to discern on a ruler scale anyway.  If the utmost accuracy is desired in a well manometer, however, we may compensate for the trifling motion of liquid in the well by building a custom ruler for the vertical tube &ndash; one with a <!-- MATH
 $255 \over 256$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 2.90ex; vertical-align: -0.90ex; " SRC="img375.svg"

<DD>It is entirely possible to perform all our calculations using inches and/or minutes as the primary units instead of feet and seconds.  The only caveat is that <SPAN  CLASS="textit">all</SPAN> units throughout all terms of Bernoulli's equation must be consistent.  This means we would also have to express mass density in units of slugs per cubic <SPAN  CLASS="textit">inch</SPAN>, the acceleration of gravity in <SPAN  CLASS="textit">inches</SPAN> per second squared (or <SPAN  CLASS="textit">inches</SPAN> per <SPAN  CLASS="textit">minute</SPAN> squared), and velocity in units of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">inches</SPAN> per second (or <SPAN  CLASS="textit">inches</SPAN> per <SPAN  CLASS="textit">minute</SPAN>).  The only real benefit of doing this is that pressure would remain in the more customary units of pounds per square <SPAN  CLASS="textit">inch</SPAN>.  My personal preference is to do all calculations using units of feet and seconds, then convert pressures in units of PSF to units of PSI at the very end.
