Review of fundamental principles</A>
</H1>

<P>
Shown here is a partial listing of principles applied in the subject matter of this chapter, given for the purpose of expanding the reader's view of this chapter's concepts and of their general inter-relationships with concepts elsewhere in the book.  Your abilities as a problem-solver and as a life-long learner will be greatly enhanced by mastering the applications of these principles to a wide variety of topics, the more varied the better.

<UL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Linear equations</SPAN>: any function represented by a straight line on a graph may be represented symbolically by the slope-intercept formula <!-- MATH
 $y = mx + b$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 2.25ex; vertical-align: -0.55ex; " SRC="img247.svg"
 ALT="$y = mx + b$"></SPAN>.  Relevant to proportional control algorithms.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Zero shift</SPAN>: any shift in the offset of an instrument is fundamentally additive, being represented by the &ldquo;intercept&rdquo; (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.80ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img14.svg"
 ALT="$b$"></SPAN>) variable of the slope-intercept linear formula <!-- MATH
 $y = mx + b$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 2.25ex; vertical-align: -0.55ex; " SRC="img247.svg"
 ALT="$y = mx + b$"></SPAN>.  Relevant to controller tuning: adjusting the &ldquo;bias&rdquo; of a loop controller always adds to or subtracts from its output signal.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Span shift</SPAN>: any shift in the gain of an instrument is fundamentally multiplicative, being represented by the &ldquo;slope&rdquo; (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.19ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img11.svg"
 ALT="$m$"></SPAN>) variable of the slope-intercept linear formula <!-- MATH
 $y = mx + b$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 2.25ex; vertical-align: -0.55ex; " SRC="img247.svg"
 ALT="$y = mx + b$"></SPAN>.  Relevant to controller tuning: adjusting the &ldquo;gain&rdquo; of a loop controller always multiplies or divides the response of its output for a given input change.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Negative feedback</SPAN>: when the output of a system is degeneratively fed back to the input of that same system, the result is decreased (overall) gain and greater stability.  Relevant to loop controller action: in order for a control system to be stable, the feedback must be negative.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Self-balancing pneumatic mechanisms</SPAN>: all self-balancing pneumatic instruments work on the principle of negative feedback maintaining a nearly constant baffle-nozzle gap.  Force-balance mechanisms maintain this constant gap by balancing force against force with negligible motion, like a tug-of-war.  Motion-balance mechanisms maintain this constant gap by balancing one motion with another motion, like two dancers moving in unison.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Self-balancing opamp circuits</SPAN>: all self-balancing operational amplifier circuits work on the principle of negative feedback maintaining a nearly zero differential input voltage to the opamp.  Making the &ldquo;simplifying assumption&rdquo; that the opamp's differential input voltage is exactly zero assists in circuit analysis, as does the assumption that the input terminals draw negligible current.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Amplification</SPAN>: the control of a relatively large signal by a relatively small signal.  Relevant to the role of loop controllers exerting influence over a process variable at the command of a measurement signal.  In behaving as amplifiers, loop controllers may oscillate if certain criteria are met.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Barkhausen criterion</SPAN>: is overall loop gain is unity (1) or greater, and phase shift is 360<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.70ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img86.svg"
 ALT="$^{o}$"></SPAN>, the loop will sustain oscillations.  Relevant to control system stability, explaining why the loop will &ldquo;cycle&rdquo; (oscillate) if gain is too high.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Time constant</SPAN>: (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.19ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img248.svg"
 ALT="$\tau$"></SPAN>), defined as the amount of time it takes a system to change 63.2% of the way from where it began to where it will eventually stabilize.  The system will be within 1% of its final value after 5 time constants' worth of time has passed (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.68ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img249.svg"
 ALT="$5 \tau$"></SPAN>).  Relevant to process control loops, where natural lags contribute to time constants, usually of multiple order.
</LI>
