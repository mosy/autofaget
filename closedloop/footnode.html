<DT><A ID="foot1050">... control</A><A
 HREF="node5.html#tex2html1"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN></SUP></A></DT>
<DD>To be precise, this form of on/off control is known as <SPAN  CLASS="textit">differential gap</SPAN> because there are two setpoints with a gap in between.  While on/off control is possible with a single setpoint (FCE on when below setpoint and off when above), it is usually not practical due to the frequent cycling of the final control element.

<DD>In electronics, the unit of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">decibels</SPAN> is commonly used to express gains.  Thankfully, the world of process control was spared the introduction of decibels as a unit of measurement for controller gain.  The last thing we need is a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">third</SPAN> way to express the degree of proportional action in a controller!

<DD>One could argue that the presence of loads actually <SPAN  CLASS="textit">justifies</SPAN> a control system, for if there were no loads, there would be nothing to compensate for, and therefore no need for an automatic control system at all!  In the total absence of loads, a manually-set final control element would be enough to hold most process variables at setpoint.

<DD>An older term for this mode of control is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">floating</SPAN>, which I happen to think is particularly descriptive.  With a &ldquo;floating&rdquo; controller, the final control element continually &ldquo;floats&rdquo; to whatever value it must in order to completely eliminate offset.

<DD>The equation for a proportional + integral controller is often written without the bias term (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.80ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img14.svg"
 ALT="$b$"></SPAN>), because the presence of integral action makes it unnecessary.  In fact, if we let the integral term completely replace the bias term, we may consider the integral term to be a self-<SPAN  CLASS="textit">resetting</SPAN> bias.  This, in fact, is the meaning of the word &ldquo;reset&rdquo; in the context of PID controller action: the &ldquo;reset&rdquo; term of the controller acts to eliminate offset by continuously adjusting (resetting) the bias as necessary.

 HREF="node8.html#tex2html7"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">7</SPAN></SUP></A></DT>
<DD>Since integration is fundamentally a process of multiplication followed by addition, the units of measurement are always the product (multiplication) of the function's variables.  In the case of reset (integral) control, we are multiplying controller error (the difference between PV and SP, usually expressed in percent) by time (usually expressed in minutes or seconds).  Therefore the result will be an &ldquo;error-time&rdquo; product.  In order for an integral controller to self-recover following windup, the error must switch signs and the error-time product accumulate to a sufficient value to cancel out the error-time product accumulated during the windup period.

 HREF="node9.html#tex2html8"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">8</SPAN></SUP></A></DT>
<DD>An example of such an application is where the output of a loop controller may be &ldquo;de-selected&rdquo; or otherwise &ldquo;over-ridden&rdquo; by some other control function.  This sort of control strategy is often used in energy-conserving controls, where multiple controllers monitoring different process variables selectively command a single FCE.

 HREF="node9.html#tex2html9"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">9</SPAN></SUP></A></DT>
<DD>It should not be assumed that such spikes are always undesirable.  In processes characterized by long lag times, such a response may be quite helpful in overcoming that lag for the purpose of rapidly achieving new setpoint values.  Slave (secondary) controllers in cascaded systems &ndash; where the controller receives its setpoint signal from the output of another (primary, or master) controller &ndash; may similarly benefit from derivative action calculated on error instead of just PV.  As usual, the specific needs of the application dictate the ideal controller configuration.

 ALT="$\int \sin x \&gt; dx = - \cos x + C = \sin (x - 90^o) + C$"></SPAN>.  This constant value is essential to explaining why the integral response does not immediately &ldquo;step&rdquo; like the derivative response does at the beginning of the PV sine wavelet.

<DD>Practical integral action also requires the elimination of the bias spring and adjustment, which formerly provided a constant downward force on the left-hand side of the beam to give the output signal the positive offset necessary to avoid saturation at 0 PSI.  Not only is a bias adjustment completely unnecessary with the addition of integral action, but it would actually cause problems by making the integral action &ldquo;think&rdquo; an error existed between PV and SP when there was none.

<DD>These restrictor valves are designed to encourage laminar air flow, making the relationship between volumetric flow rate and differential pressure drop <SPAN  CLASS="textit">linear</SPAN> rather than quadratic as it is for large control valves.  Thus, a doubling of pressure drop across the restrictor valve results in a doubling of flow rate into (or out of) the reset bellows, and a consequent doubling of integration rate.  This is precisely what we desire and expect from a controller with integral action.

 HREF="node14.html#tex2html20"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">20</SPAN></SUP></A></DT>
<DD>The reason for this is the low component count compared to a comparable digital control circuit.  For any given technology, a simpler device will tend to be more reliable than a complex device if only due to there being fewer components to fail.  This also suggests a third advantage of analog controllers over digital controllers, and that is the possibility of easily designing and constructing your own for some custom application such as a hobby project.  A digital controller is not outside the reach of a serious hobbyist to design and build, but it is definitely more challenging due to the requirement of programming expertise in addition to electronic hardware expertise.

<DD>It is noteworthy that analog control systems are completely immune from &ldquo;cyber-attacks&rdquo; (malicious attempts to foil the integrity of a control system by remote access), due to the simple fact that their algorithms are fixed by physical laws and properties of electronic components rather than by code which may be edited.  This new threat constitutes an inherent weakness of digital technology, and has spurred some thinkers in the field to reconsider analog controls for the most critical applications.

<DD>This circuit configuration is called &ldquo;inverting&rdquo; because the mathematical sign of the output is always opposite that of the input.  This sign inversion is not an intentional circuit feature, but rather a consequence of the input signal facing the opamp's inverting input.  Non-inverting multiplier circuits also exist, but are more complicated when built to achieve multiplication factors less than one.

<DD>This inversion of function caused by the swapping of input and feedback components in an operational amplifier circuit points to a fundamental principle of negative feedback networks: namely, that placing a mathematical element within the feedback loop causes the amplifier to exhibit the inverse of that element's intrinsic function.  This is why voltage dividers placed within the feedback loop cause an opamp to have a multiplicative gain (division <!-- MATH
 $\rightarrow$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.04ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img158.svg"
 ALT="$\rightarrow$"></SPAN> multiplication).  A circuit element exhibiting a logarithmic response, when placed within a negative feedback loop, will cause the amplifier to exhibit an exponential response (logarithm <!-- MATH
 $\rightarrow$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.04ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img158.svg"
 ALT="$\rightarrow$"></SPAN> exponent).  Here, an element having a time-differentiating response, when placed inside the feedback loop, causes the amplifier to time-integrate (differentiation <!-- MATH
 $\rightarrow$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.04ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img158.svg"
 ALT="$\rightarrow$"></SPAN> integration).  Since the opamp's output voltage must assume any value possible to maintain (nearly) zero differential voltage at the input terminals, placing a mathematical function in the feedback loop forces the output to assume the inverse of that function in order to &ldquo;cancel out&rdquo; its effects and achieve balance at the input terminals.

<DD>If this is not apparent, imagine a scenario where the +1.7 volt input existed for precisely one second's worth of time.  However much the output voltage ramps in that amount of time must therefore be its rate of change in volts per second (assuming a linear ramp).  Since we know the area accumulated under a constant value of 1.7 (high) over a time of 1 second (wide) must be 1.7 volt-seconds, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.54ex; vertical-align: -0.45ex; " SRC="img45.svg"

<DD>An interesting example of engineering tradition is found in electronic PID controller designs.  While it is not too terribly difficult to build an analog electronic controller implementing either the parallel or ideal PID equation (just a few more parts are needed), it is quite challenging to do the same in a pneumatic mechanism.  When analog electronic controllers were first introduced to industry, they were often destined to replace old pneumatic controllers.  In order to ease the transition from pneumatic to electronic control, manufacturers built their new electronic controllers to behave exactly the same as the old pneumatic controllers they would be replacing.  The same legacy followed the advent of digital electronic controllers: many digital controllers were programmed to behave in the same manner as the old pneumatic controllers, for the sake of operational familiarity, not because it was easier to design a digital controller that way.

<DD>Although the SPEC 200 system &ndash; like most analog electronic control systems &ndash; is considered &ldquo;mature&rdquo; (Foxboro officially declared the SPEC 200 and SPEC 200 Micro systems as such in March 2007), working installations may still be found at the time of this writing (2010).  A report published by the Electric Power Research Institute (see References at the end of this chapter) in 2001 documents a SPEC 200 analog control system installed in a nuclear power plant in the United States as recently as 1992, and another as recently as 2001 in a Korean nuclear power plant.

<DD>Foxboro provided the option of a self-contained, panel-mounted SPEC 200 controller unit with all electronics contained in a single module, but the split architecture of the display/nest areas was preferred for large installations where many dozens of loops (especially cascade, feedforward, ratio, and other multi-component control strategies) would be serviced by the same system.

<DD>I once encountered an engineer who joked that the number &ldquo;200&rdquo; in &ldquo;SPEC 200&rdquo; represented the number of years the system was designed to continuously operate.  At another facility, I encountered instrument technicians who were a bit afraid of a SPEC 200 system running a section of their plant: the system had <SPAN  CLASS="textit">never suffered a failure of any kind</SPAN> since it was installed decades ago, and as a result no one in the shop had any experience troubleshooting it.  As it turns out, the entire facility was eventually shut down and sold, with the SPEC 200 nest running faithfully until the day its power was turned off!  The functioning SPEC 200 controllers shown in the photograph were in continuous use at British Columbia Institute of Technology at the time of the photograph, taken in December of 2014.

<DD>An aspect common to many PLC implementations of PID control is the use of the &ldquo;parallel&rdquo; PID algorithm instead of the superior &ldquo;ISA&rdquo; or &ldquo;non-interacting&rdquo; algorithm.  The choice of algorithm may have a profound effect on tuning, and on tuning procedures, especially when tuning parameters must be re-adjusted to accommodate changes in transmitter range.

<DD>Modern DDC systems of the type used for building automation (heating, cooling, security, etc.) almost always consist of networked control nodes, each node tasked with monitoring and control of a limited area.  The same may be said for modern PLC technology, which not only exhibits advanced networking capability (fieldbus I/O networks, Ethernet, Modbus, wireless communications), but is often also capable of redundancy in both processing and I/O.  As technology becomes more sophisticated, the distinction between a DDC (or a networked PLC system) and a DCS becomes more ambiguous.

<DD>To be fair, the Yokogawa Electric Corporation of Japan introduced their CENTUM distributed control system the same year as Honeywell.  Unfortunately, while I have personal experience maintaining and using the Honeywell TDC2000 system, I have zero personal experience with the Yokogawa CENTUM system, and neither have I been able to obtain technical documentation for the original incarnation of this DCS (Yokogawa's latest DCS offering goes by the same name).  Consequently, I can do little in this chapter but mention its existence, despite the fact that it deserves just as much recognition as the Honeywell TDC2000 system.

<DD>Just to give some perspective, the original TDC2000 system used whole-board processors rather than microprocessor chips, and magnetic core memory rather than static or dynamic RAM circuits!  Communication between controller nodes and operator stations occurred over thick coaxial cables, implementing master/slave arbitration with a separate device (a &ldquo;Hiway Traffic Director&rdquo; or HTD) coordinating all communications between nodes.  Like Bob Metcalfe's original version of Ethernet, these coaxial cables were terminated at their end-points by termination resistors, with coaxial &ldquo;tee&rdquo; connectors providing branch points for multiple nodes to connect along the network.

<DD>The only reason I say &ldquo;may&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;will&rdquo; is because some modern digital controllers are designed to automatically switch to manual-mode operation in the event of a sensor or transmitter signal loss.  Any controller not &ldquo;smart&rdquo; enough to shed its operating mode to manual in the event of PV signal loss will react dramatically when that PV signal dies, and this is not a good thing for an operating loop!

<DD>I once had the misfortune of working on an analog PID controller for a chlorine-based wastewater disinfection system that lacked output tracking.  The chlorine sensor on this system would occasionally fail due to sample system plugging by algae in the wastewater.  When this happened, the PV signal would fail low (indicating abnormally low levels of chlorine gas dissolved in the wastewater) even though the actual dissolved chlorine gas concentration was adequate.  The controller, thinking the PV was well below SP, would ramp the chlorine gas control valve further and further open over time, as integral action attempted to reduce the error between PV and SP.  The error never went away, of course, because the chlorine sensor was plugged with algae and simply could not detect the actual chlorine gas concentration in the wastewater.  By the time I arrived to address the &ldquo;low chlorine&rdquo; alarm, the controller output was already wound up to 100%.  After cleaning the sensor, and seeing the PV value jump up to some outrageously high level, the controller would take a long time to &ldquo;wind down&rdquo; its output because its integral action was very slow.  I could not use manual mode to &ldquo;unwind&rdquo; the output signal, because this controller lacked the feature of output tracking.  My &ldquo;work-around&rdquo; solution to this problem was to re-tune the integral term of the controller to some really fast time constant, watch the output &ldquo;wind down&rdquo; in fast-motion until it reached a reasonable value, then adjust the integral time constant back to its previous value for continued automatic operation.
