<DD>Liquids are considered &ldquo;miscible&rdquo; if they may be mixed in any proportion to each other to form a solution.  Immiscible liquids refuse to mix thoroughly, and therefore tend to separate.

<DD>A spring-loaded cable float only works with liquid level measurement, while a retracting float will measure liquids and solids with equal ease.  The reason for this limitation is simple: a float that always contacts the material surface is likely to become buried if the material in question is a solid (powder or granules), which must be fed into the vessel from above.

<DD>We may prove this mathematically by algebraic substitution.  Given that the total mass (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.19ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img41.svg"
 ALT="$m$"></SPAN>) of any liquid sample is equal to the product of that liquid's mass density and its sample volume (<!-- MATH
 $m = \rho V$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 2.22ex; vertical-align: -0.55ex; " SRC="img42.svg"
 ALT="$m = \rho V$"></SPAN>), that volume (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.77ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img43.svg"
 ALT="$V$"></SPAN>) for any vessel of constant cross-sectional area (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.77ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img44.svg"
 ALT="$A$"></SPAN>) is given by the expression <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.80ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img45.svg"
 ALT="$V = Ah$"></SPAN>, and that hydrostatic pressure is equal to <!-- MATH
 $P = \rho g h$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 2.25ex; vertical-align: -0.55ex; " SRC="img46.svg"
 ALT="$P = \rho g h$"></SPAN>, we may combine these three equations to arrive at <!-- MATH

 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 3.26ex; vertical-align: -1.20ex; " SRC="img47.svg"
 ALT="$m = {AP \over g}$"></SPAN>.  This final equation demonstrates how the total mass of liquid stored in a vessel (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.19ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img41.svg"
 ALT="$m$"></SPAN>) of constant cross-sectional area (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.77ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img44.svg"

 HREF="node2.html#tex2html5"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">5</SPAN></SUP></A></DT>
<DD>There is some disagreement among instrumentation professionals as to the definitions of these two terms.  According to Béla G. Lipták's <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Instrument Engineers' Handbook, Process Measurement and Analysis</SPAN> (Fourth Edition, page 67), &ldquo;suppressed zero range&rdquo; refers to the transmitter being located below the 0% level (the LRV being a positive pressure value), while &ldquo;suppression,&rdquo; &ldquo;suppressed range,&rdquo; and &ldquo;suppressed span&rdquo; mean exactly the opposite (LRV is a negative value).  The Yokogawa Corporation defines &ldquo;suppression&rdquo; as a condition where the LRV is a positive pressure (&ldquo;Autolevel&rdquo; Application Note), as does the Michael MacBeth in his CANDU Instrumentation &amp; Control course (lesson 1, module 4, page 12), Foxboro's technical notes on bubble tube installations (pages 4 through 7), and Rosemount's product manual for their 1151 Alphaline pressure transmitter (page 3-7).  Interestingly, the Rosemount document defines &ldquo;zero range suppression&rdquo; as synonymous with &ldquo;suppression,&rdquo; which disagrees with Lipták's distinction.  My advice: draw a picture if you want the other person to clearly understand what you mean!

 HREF="node2.html#tex2html6"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">6</SPAN></SUP></A></DT>
<DD>As you are about to see, the calibration of an elevated transmitter depends on us knowing how much hydrostatic pressure (or vacuum, in this case) is generated within the tube connecting the transmitter to the process vessel.  If liquid were to ever escape from this tube, the hydrostatic pressure would be unpredictable, and so would be the accuracy of our transmitter as a level-measuring instrument.  A remote seal diaphragm guarantees no fill fluid will be lost if and when the process vessel goes empty.

<DD>The sea water's positive pressure at the remote seal diaphragm adds to the negative pressure already generated by the downward length of the capillary tube's fill fluid (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.88ex; vertical-align: -0.29ex; " SRC="img61.svg"
 ALT="$-2.43$"></SPAN> PSI), which explains why the transmitter only &ldquo;sees&rdquo; 2.46 PSI of pressure at the 100% full mark.

 HREF="node2.html#tex2html9"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">9</SPAN></SUP></A></DT>
<DD>This is due to limited transmitter resolution.  Imagine an application where the elevation head was 10 PSI (maximum) yet the vapor space pressure was 200 PSI.  The majority of each transmitter's working range would be &ldquo;consumed&rdquo; measuring gas pressure, with hydrostatic head being a mere 5% of the measurement range.  This would make precise measurement of liquid level very difficult, akin to trying to measure the sound intensity of a whisper in a noisy room.

<DD>Assuming the liquid level is equal to or greater than <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.19ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img79.svg"
 ALT="$x$"></SPAN>.  Otherwise, the pressure difference between <!-- MATH

 $P_{middle}$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 2.12ex; vertical-align: -0.45ex; " SRC="img82.svg"

<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 2.12ex; vertical-align: -0.45ex; " SRC="img82.svg"
 ALT="$P_{middle}$"></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 2.42ex; vertical-align: -0.75ex; " SRC="img83.svg"

<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 2.12ex; vertical-align: -0.45ex; " SRC="img82.svg"
 ALT="$P_{middle}$"></SPAN> registers the same as <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 2.42ex; vertical-align: -0.75ex; " SRC="img83.svg"
 ALT="$P_{top}$"></SPAN>, the computer knows those two transmitters are both registering gas pressure only, and it knows to stop calculating density.

 HREF="node2.html#tex2html11"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">11</SPAN></SUP></A></DT>
<DD>The details of this math depend entirely on the shape of the tank.  For vertical cylinders &ndash; the most common shape for vented storage tanks &ndash; volume and height are related by the simple formula <!-- MATH
 $V = \pi r^2 h$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 2.03ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img92.svg"
 ALT="$V = \pi r^2 h$"></SPAN> where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.19ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img93.svg"
 ALT="$r$"></SPAN> is the radius of the tank's circular base.  Other tank shapes and orientations may require much more sophisticated formulae to calculate stored volume from height.  See section <A HREF="#Storage_tank_characterization"><IMG  ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A> beginning on page <A HREF="#Storage_tank_characterization"><IMG  ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A>, for more details on this subject.

<DD>Remember that a differential pressure instrument cannot &ldquo;tell the difference&rdquo; between a positive pressure applied to the low side, an equal vacuum applied to the high side, or an equivalent difference of two positive pressures with the low side's pressure exceeding the high side's pressure.  Simulating the exact process pressures experienced in the field to a transmitter on a workbench would be exceedingly complicated, so we &ldquo;cheat&rdquo; by simplifying the calibration setup and applying the equivalent difference of pressure only to the &ldquo;low&rdquo; side.

<DD>This is not unlike the experience of feeling lighter when you are standing in a pool of water just deep enough to submerge most of your body with your feet touching the bottom.

<DD>So-called for its ability to &ldquo;knock out&rdquo; (separate and collect) condensible vapors from the gas stream.  This particular photograph was taken at a natural gas compression facility, where it is very important the gas to be compressed is dry (since liquids are essentially incompressible).  Sending even relatively small amounts of liquid into a compressor may cause the compressor to catastrophically fail!

 HREF="node2.html#tex2html16"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">16</SPAN></SUP></A></DT>
<DD>To anyone familiar with the front suspension of a 1960's vintage Chevrolet truck, or the suspension of the original Volkswagen &ldquo;Beetle&rdquo; car, the concept of a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">torsion bar</SPAN> should be familiar.  These vehicles used straight, spring-steel rods to provide suspension force instead of the more customary coil springs used in modern vehicles.  However, even the familiar coil spring is an example of torsional forces at work: a coil spring is nothing more than a torsion bar bent in a coil shape.  As a coil spring is stretched or compressed, torsional forces develop along the circumferential length of the spring coil, which is what makes the spring &ldquo;try&rdquo; to maintain a fixed height.

<DD>The speed of sound through any substance is a function of both the substance's density and its bulk modulus (i.e. the compressibility of a substance).  Mathematically, <!-- MATH

 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 4.45ex; vertical-align: -1.65ex; " SRC="img168.svg"

 ALT="$c$"></SPAN> is the sonic velocity, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.77ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img170.svg"
 ALT="$B$"></SPAN> is the bulk modulus, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.64ex; vertical-align: -0.55ex; " SRC="img21.svg"
 ALT="$\rho$"></SPAN> is the mass density.  Water and air provide an excellent illustration of this principle: the speed of sound through water happens to be much faster than the speed of sound through air despite the vastly greater mass density of water, only because of the even greater disparity in bulk modulus between water and air.

<DD>In the industrial instrumentation world, the word &ldquo;transducer&rdquo; usually has a very specific meaning: a device used to process or convert standardized instrumentation signals, such as 4-20 mA converted into 3-15 PSI, etc.  In the general scientific world, however, the word &ldquo;transducer&rdquo; describes any device converting one form of energy into another.  It is this latter definition of the word that I am using when I describe an ultrasonic &ldquo;transducer&rdquo; &ndash; a device used to convert electrical energy into ultrasonic sound waves, and vice-versa.

<DD>Dielectric permittivity is one of the factors determining the speed of any electromagnetic wave through a substance, but not the only one.  The material's <SPAN  CLASS="textit">magnetic permeability</SPAN> is another factor, but it is far more common to encounter interfaces of gas-liquid or liquid-liquid where differences in permittivity rather than differences in permeability constitute the major reason for differences in radio wave velocity.

<DD>For vented-tank level measurement applications where air is the only substance above the point of interest, the relative permittivity is so close to a value of 1 that there is little need for further consideration on this point.  Where the permittivity of fluids becomes a problem for radar is in high-pressure (non-air) gas applications and liquid-liquid interface applications, especially where the upper substance composition is subject to change.

Laying a long piece of rope in a straight line on the ground, pick up one end and quickly move it in a tight circle using a &ldquo;flip&rdquo; motion of your wrist.  You should be able to see the torsional pulse travel down the length of the rope until it either dies out from dissipation or it reaches the rope's end.  As with the torsional pulse in a magnetostrictive waveguide, this pulse in the rope is mechanical in nature: a movement of the rod's (rope's) molecules.  As a mechanical wave, it may be properly understood as a form of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">sound</SPAN>.

<DD>One reference gives the speed of sound in a magnetostrictive level instrument as 2850 meters per second.  Rounding this up to <!-- MATH
 $3 \times 10^3$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 2.22ex; vertical-align: -0.29ex; " SRC="img217.svg"
 ALT="$3 \times 10^3$"></SPAN> m/s, we find that the speed of sound in the magnetostrictive waveguide is at least <SPAN  CLASS="textit">five orders of magnitude slower</SPAN> than the speed of light in a vacuum (approximately <!-- MATH
 $3 \times 10^8$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 2.22ex; vertical-align: -0.29ex; " SRC="img218.svg"
 ALT="$3 \times 10^8$"></SPAN> m/s).  This relative slowness of wave propagation is a good thing for our purposes here, as it gives more time for the electronic timing circuit to count, yielding a more precise measurement of distance traveled by the wave.  This fact grants superior resolution of measurement to magnetostrictive level sensors over radar-based and laser-based level sensors.  Open-air ultrasonic level instruments deal with propagation speeds even slower than this (principally because the bulk moduli of gases and vapors is far less than that of a solid metal rod) which at first might seem to give these level sensors the advantage in precision.  However, open-air level sensors experience far greater propagation velocity variations caused by changes in pressure and temperature than magnetostrictive sensors.  Unlike the speed of sound in gases or liquids, the speed of sound in a solid metal rod is very stable over a large range of process temperatures, and practically constant for a large range of process pressures.  Another factor adding to the calibration stability of magnetostrictive instruments is that the composition of the medium never changes.  With instruments measuring time-of-flight through process fluids, the chemical composition of those fluids often affects the wave velocity.  In a magnetostrictive instrument, the waves are always traveling through the same material &ndash; the metal of the waveguide bar &ndash; and thus are not subject to variation with process changes.

<DD>One practical solution to this problem is to shut down the source of vibration (e.g. agitator motor, pump, etc.) for a long enough time to take a sample weight measurement, then run the machine again between measurements.  So long as intermittent weight measurement is adequate for the needs of the process, the interference of machine vibration may be dealt with in this manner.

To illustrate, a 10-gram quantity consisting of 100% Cobalt-60 atoms will only contain 5 grams of Cobalt-60 after 5.3 years, and then only 2.5 grams of Cobalt-60 after another 5.3 years (10.6 years from the start), and so on.  The actual mass of the sample does not change significantly over this time period because the Cobalt atoms have decayed into atoms of Nickel, which still have the same atomic mass value.  However, the intensity of the gamma radiation emitted by the sample decreases over time, proportional to the percentage of Cobalt remaining therein.
