Mange industrielle prosesser krever nøyaktig måling av væske eller faststoff(pulver, granulato o.l.) høyde i en tank. I noen beholdere har ulike væsker inndelt i naturlig dannede lag. Her er en interesert i å måle hvor disse lagene er. <A NAME="34"></A>

Level gauges (sightglasses)</A>
</H1>

<P>
Level gauges are perhaps the simplest indicating instrument for liquid level in a vessel.  They are often found in industrial level-measurement applications, even when another level-measuring instrument is present, to serve as a direct indicator for an operator to monitor in case there is doubt about the accuracy of the other instrument.

The <SPAN  CLASS="textit">level gauge</SPAN>, or <SPAN  CLASS="textit">sightglass</SPAN> is to liquid level measurement as manometers are to pressure measurement: a very simple and effective technology for direct visual indication of process level.  In its simplest form, a level gauge is nothing more than a clear tube through which process liquid may be seen.  The following photograph shows a simple example of a sightglass: <A NAME="39"></A> <A NAME="40"></A>

A functional diagram of a sightglass shows how it visually represents the level of liquid inside a vessel such as a storage tank:

<P>
A level gauge is not unlike a U-tube manometer, with equal pressures applied to both liquid columns (one column being the liquid in the gauge sightglass, the other column being the liquid in the vessel).

<P>
Level gauge valves exist to allow replacement of the glass tube without emptying or depressurizing the process vessel.  These valves are usually equipped with flow-limiting devices in the event of a tube rupture, so too much process fluid does not escape even when the valves are fully open.

<P>
Some level gauges called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">reflex gauges</SPAN> are equipped with special optics to facilitate the viewing of clear liquids, which is problematic for simple glass-tube sightglasses.

<P>

<P>
A weakness of glass-tube level gauges is the glass tube itself.  The tube must be kept in a clean condition in order for the liquid level to be clearly visible, which may be a problem in a dirty-liquid service.  Also, glass tubes may rupture if subjected to thermal or mechanical shock.  One solution to this problem is to eliminate the glass tube entirely, replacing it with a non-magnetic metal tube (e.g. stainless steel) containing a magnetized float, with magnet-sensing indicator flags outside of this tube to visually indicate level.  Here is one example of such a level gauge, manufactured by MagTech:  <A NAME="44"></A>

</DIV><P></P>

<P>
In this instrument, you can see red-colored flags toward the bottom of the scale which have been &ldquo;flipped&rdquo; by the motion of the magnetic float inside the stainless-steel tube.  The height of the red zone (i.e. how many flags have been flipped to show their red sides) indicates the height of the liquid inside the tube.  

<P>
Some magnetic level gauges even have high- and low-level magnetic switches located at strategic points along the tube's height, providing discrete sensing capability for alarms and/or shutdown controls, if the liquid level ever goes outside of safe operating limits.  These switches will open and close as the magnetic float passes by, remotely signaling liquid level at that height.

Interface problems</A>
</H2>

<P>
As simple and apparently trouble-free as level gauges may seem, there are special circumstances where they will register incorrectly.  One such circumstance is in the presence of a lighter liquid layer existing between the connection ports of the gauge.  If a lighter (less dense) liquid exists above a heavier (denser) liquid in the process vessel, the level gauge may not show the proper interface, if at all:

A practical application of level measurement where two liquids form an interface is where water exists in the presence of petroleum substances, such as diesel fuel.  Water is a denser liquid than most oils, and these two liquids are immiscible<A ID="tex2html1"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot48"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN></SUP></A>, which means the denser water forms a separate layer beneath the lighter oil.  Another application of interface measurement is in the oil and gas extraction industry, where water must be separated from petroleum fluids coming out of wells drilled deep into the earth.  Fluid from an oil well enters a special vessel called a &ldquo;separator&rdquo; where gravity causes the water to separate from the petroleum liquids, and petroleum vapors to separate from all liquids.  These water/oil/gas separator vessels are critical components of any petroleum well system, with the liquid-liquid interface between water and oil being an important process variable to measure and control.

<P>
In the above illustration we see how a column of water in the sightglass shows less (total) level than the combination of water and oil inside a process vessel.  Since the oil lies between the two level gauge ports into the vessel (sometimes called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">nozzles</SPAN>), it cannot enter the sightglass tube, and therefore the level gauge will continue to show just water.  <A NAME="50"></A>

<P>

<P>
If by chance some oil does find its way into the sightglass tube &ndash; either by the interface level dropping below the lower nozzle or the total level rising above the upper nozzle &ndash; the oil/water interface shown inside the level gauge may not continue to reflect the true interface inside the vessel once the interface and total levels return to their previous positions:

<P>
Recall that the level gauge and vessel together form a U-tube manometer.  So long as the pressures from each liquid column are the same, the columns balance each other.  The problem is, many different liquid-liquid interface columns can have the same hydrostatic pressure without being identical to one another:

The only way to ensure proper two-part liquid interface level indication in a sightglass is to keep both ports (nozzles) submerged:

Temperature problems</A>
</H2>

<P>
Another troublesome scenario for level gauges is when the liquid inside the vessel is substantially hotter than the liquid in the gauge, causing the densities to be different.  This is commonly seen on boiler level gauges, where the water inside the sightglass cools off substantially from its former temperature inside the boiler drum:

Looking at the sightglass as a U-tube manometer again, we see that unequal-height liquid columns may indeed balance each other's hydrostatic pressures if the two columns are comprised of liquids with different densities.  The weight density of water is 62.4 lb/ft<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 2.03ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img9.svg"

Float</A>
</H1>

<P>
Perhaps the simplest form of solid or liquid level measurement is with a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">float</SPAN>: a device that rides on the surface of the fluid or solid within the storage vessel.  The float itself must be of substantially lesser density than the substance of interest, and it must not corrode or otherwise react with the substance. <A NAME="61"></A>

<P>
Floats may be used for manual &ldquo;gauging&rdquo; of level, as illustrated here:

<P>
A person lowers a float down into a storage vessel using a flexible measuring tape, until the tape goes slack due to the float coming to rest on the material surface.  At that point, the person notes the length indicated on the tape (reading off the lip of the vessel access hole).  This distance is called the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">ullage</SPAN>, being the distance from the top of the vessel to the surface of the process material.  <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Fillage</SPAN> of the vessel may be determined by subtracting this &ldquo;ullage&rdquo; measurement from the known height of the vessel.  <A NAME="65"></A>  <A NAME="66"></A>

<P>
Obviously, this method of level measurement is tedious and may pose risk to the person conducting the measurement.  If the vessel is pressurized, this method is simply not applicable.

<P>

<P>
If we automate the person's function using a small winch controlled by a computer &ndash; having the computer automatically lower the float down to the material surface and measure the amount of cable played out at each measurement cycle &ndash; we may achieve better results without human intervention.  Such a level gauge may be enclosed in such a way to allow pressurization of the vessel, too:

A simpler version of this technique uses a spring-reel to constantly tension the cable holding the float, such that the float continuously rides on the surface of the liquid in the vessel<A ID="tex2html2"

The following photograph shows the &ldquo;measurement head&rdquo; of a spring-reel tape-and-float liquid level transmitter, with the vertical pipe housing the tape on its way to the top of the storage tank where it will turn 180 degrees via two pulleys and attach to the float inside the tank:

The spring reel's angular position may be measured by a multi-turn potentiometer or a rotary encoder (located inside the &ldquo;head&rdquo; unit), then converted to an electronic signal for transmission to a remote display, control, and/or recording system.  Such systems are used extensively for measurement of water and fuel in storage tanks.  <A NAME="71"></A>

If the liquid inside the vessel is subject to turbulence, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">guide wires</SPAN> may be necessary to keep the float cable in a vertical orientation:

</DIV><P></P>

<P>
The guide wires are anchored to the floor and roof of the vessel, passing through ring lugs on the float to keep it from straying laterally.

<P>
One of the potential disadvantages of tape-and-float level measurement systems is fouling of the tape (and guide wires) if the substance is sticky or unclean.

<P>
<P>
A variation on the theme of float level measurement is to place a small float inside the tube of a sightglass-style level gauge:

<P>
<P><!-- MATH
 \begin{displaymath}

 ALT="$\displaystyle \includegraphics{level26.eps}$">
</DIV><P></P>

<P>
The float's position inside the tube may be readily detected by ultrasonic waves, magnetic sensors or any other applicable means.  Locating the float inside a tube eliminates the need for guide wires or a sophisticated tape retraction or tensioning system.  If no visual indication is necessary, the level gauge tube may be constructed out of metal instead of glass, greatly reducing the risk of tube breakage.  All the problems inherent to sightglasses, however, still apply to this form of float instrument.

<P>

<P>
The following photograph shows just such a float-style level indicator, manufactured by K-Tek.  This particular level indicator is removed from the process, sitting on a concrete floor for the photograph.  A magnetic float rides on the surface of a liquid column inside a non-magnetic metal tube, while a brightly-colored indicating flag tracks the magnetic float's position inside a transparent plastic tube for convenient viewing:  <A NAME="75"></A>

<P>
Two major advantages of a magnetically-coupled float is increased pressure rating and safety (since the float tube need not be constructed of clear material such as plastic or glass), and increased readability (since the viewing tube will never get dirty with process fluid residue, and the float may be brightly colored).

<P>

<P>
This particular level indicator also has a special pneumatic valve mounted to the side of the non-magnetic metal tube.  This valve is actuated by the magnetic field of the float, turning a pneumatic &ldquo;circuit&rdquo; on and off based on the float's position:

<P>
This is just one example of auxiliary functions possible with magnetic float level indicators.  Such a pneumatic valve may be used to control a larger process valve to redirect liquid to or from the vessel based on level, to trip an operator alarm, or any number of other automatic functions.

Another variation on the theme of auxiliary float functions is a principle called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">magnetostriction</SPAN> to detect the position of the float along a metal guide rod called a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">waveguide</SPAN>.

A vertical column of fluid generates a pressure at the bottom of the column owing to the action of gravity on that fluid.  The greater the vertical height of the fluid, the greater the pressure, all other factors being equal.  This principle allows us to infer the level (height) of liquid in a vessel by pressure measurement.

In most level-measurement applications, we are concerned with knowing the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">volume</SPAN> of the liquid contained within a vessel, and we infer this volume by using instruments to sense the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">height</SPAN> of the fluid column.  So long as the vessel's cross-sectional area is constant throughout its height, liquid height will be directly proportional to stored liquid volume.  Pressure measured at the bottom of a vessel can give us a proportional indication of liquid height if and only if the density of that liquid is known and constant.  This means liquid density is a critically important factor for volumetric measurement when using hydrostatic pressure-sensing instruments.  If liquid density is subject to random change, the accuracy of any hydrostatic pressure-based level or volume instrument will be correspondingly unreliable. <A NAME="133"></A>

<P>
It should be noted, though, that changes in liquid density will have absolutely no effect on hydrostatic measurement of liquid <SPAN  CLASS="textit">mass</SPAN>, so long as the vessel has a constant cross-sectional area throughout its entire height.  A simple thought experiment proves this: imagine a vessel partially full of liquid, with a pressure transmitter attached to the bottom to measure hydrostatic pressure.  Now imagine the temperature of that liquid increasing, such that its volume expands and has a lower density than before.  Assuming no addition or loss of liquid to or from the vessel, any increase in liquid level will be strictly due to volume expansion (density decrease).  Liquid level inside this vessel will rise, but the transmitter will sense the exact same hydrostatic pressure as before, since the rise in level is precisely countered by the decrease in density (if <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.80ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img24.svg"
 ALT="$h$"></SPAN> increases by the same factor that <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.64ex; vertical-align: -0.55ex; " SRC="img23.svg"

 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 2.25ex; vertical-align: -0.55ex; " SRC="img39.svg"
 ALT="$P = \gamma h$"></SPAN> must remain the same!).  In other words, hydrostatic pressure is seen to be directly proportional to the amount of liquid <SPAN  CLASS="textit">mass</SPAN> contained within the vessel, regardless of changes in liquid density.  This is useful to know in applications where true mass measurement of a liquid (rather than volume measurement) is either preferable or necessary<A ID="tex2html3"

Differential pressure transmitters are the most common pressure-sensing device used in this capacity to infer liquid level within a vessel.

Connected as such, the differential pressure transmitter functions as a gauge pressure transmitter, responding to hydrostatic pressure exceeding ambient (atmospheric) pressure.  As liquid level increases, the hydrostatic pressure applied to the &ldquo;high&rdquo; side of the differential pressure transmitter also increases, driving the transmitter's output signal higher.

Bubbler systems</A>

An interesting variation on this theme of direct hydrostatic pressure measurement is the use of a purge gas to measure hydrostatic pressure in a liquid-containing vessel.  This eliminates the need for direct contact of the process liquid against the pressure-sensing element, which can be advantageous if the process liquid is corrosive.

<P>
Such systems are often called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">bubble tube</SPAN> or <SPAN  CLASS="textit">dip tube</SPAN> systems, the former name being appropriately descriptive for the way purge gas bubbles out the end of the tube as it is submerged in process liquid.  A very simple bubbler system may be simulated by gently blowing air through a straw into a glass of water, maintaining a steady rate of bubbles exiting the straw while changing the depth of the straw's end in the water:

<P>
The deeper you submerge the straw, the harder it becomes to blow bubbles out the end with your breath.  The hydrostatic pressure of the water at the straw's tip becomes translated into air pressure in your mouth as you blow, since the air pressure must just exceed the water's pressure in order to escape out the end of the straw.  So long as the flow rate of air is modest (no more than a few bubbles per second), the air pressure will be very nearly equal to the water pressure, allowing measurement of water pressure (and therefore water depth) at any point along the length of the air tube.

<P>

<P>
If we lengthen the straw and measure pressure at all points throughout its length, it will be the same as the pressure at the submerged tip of the straw (assuming negligible friction between the moving air molecules and the straw's interior walls):

This is how industrial &ldquo;bubbler&rdquo; level measurement systems work: a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">purge gas</SPAN> is slowly introduced into a &ldquo;dip tube&rdquo; submerged in the process liquid, so that no more than a few bubbles per second of gas emerge from the tube's end.  Gas pressure inside all points of the tubing system will (very nearly) equal the hydrostatic pressure of the liquid at the tube's submerged end.  Any pressure-measuring device tapped anywhere along the length of this tubing system will sense this pressure and be able to infer the depth of the liquid in the process vessel without having to directly contact the process liquid.

<P>
Bubbler-style liquid level measurement systems are especially useful when the process liquid in question is highly corrosive, prone to plugging sample ports, or in any other way objectionable to have in direct contact with a pressure sensor.  Unlike pressure sensors which must use diaphragms or other flexible (usually metallic) sensing elements and therefore may only be constructed from a limited range of materials, a dip tube need not be flexible and therefore may be constructed of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">any</SPAN> material capable of withstanding the process liquid.  A process liquid so corrosive that non-metallic vessels are required to hold it would preclude direct contact with a metal pressure gauge or pressure transmitter, but would be easily measured with a bubbler system provided the dip tube were made out of plastic, ceramic, or some other material immune to corrosion.  A process liquid so laden with solids that it plugs up any non-flowing port would preclude pressure measurement via a sample port and impulse line, but would be easily measured by a bubbler system where the dip tube is continuously purged with clean gas.  Level measurement applications where direct contact with the pressure sensor would render access to that sensor inconvenient or even impossible are made much more practical by using a bubbler system, where the pressure sensor may be located <SPAN  CLASS="textit">anywhere</SPAN> along the dip tube's length and therefore easily located where maintenance personnel can access it.

<P>

<P>
Excessive purge gas flow through the tube will result in additional pressure caused by frictional pressure drop along the tube's length, causing the pressure-sensing instrument to falsely register high.  A key detail of any practical bubble tube system, therefore, is some means to monitor and control gas flow through the tube.  A common construction uses either a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">rotameter</SPAN> or a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">sightfeed bubbler</SPAN> to monitor purge gas flow rate, with a needle valve to restrict that flow: <A NAME="163"></A> <A NAME="164"></A> <A NAME="165"></A> <A NAME="166"></A> <A NAME="167"></A>

A more sophisticated solution to the problem of purge gas flow rate is to install a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">flow-regulator</SPAN> in lieu of a pressure regulator and needle valve, a mechanism designed to automatically monitor and throttle gas flow to maintain a constant purge rate.  Flow regulators compensate for changes in dip tube pressure and in gas supply pressure, eliminating the need for a human operator to periodically adjust a needle valve.

<P>
Limiting the flow of purge gas is also important if that purge gas is expensive to obtain.  For bottled gases such as nitrogen (necessary in processes requiring a non-reactive purge), the cost of purchasing tanks of compressed gas is obvious.  For air-purged systems the cost is still present, but not so obvious: the cost of running an air compressor to maintain continuous purge air pressure.  Either way, limiting the flow rate of purge gas in a bubbler system yields economic benefits aside from increased measurement accuracy.

<P>

<P>
As with all purged systems, certain criteria must be met for successful operation.  Listed here are some of them:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The purge gas supply must be reliable: if the flow stops for any reason, the level measurement will cease to be accurate, and the dip tube may even plug with debris!
</LI>
<LI>The purge gas supply pressure must exceed the hydrostatic pressure at all times, or else the level measurement range will fall below the actual liquid level.
</LI>
<LI>The purge gas flow must be maintained at a low rate, to avoid pressure drop errors (i.e. excess pressure measured due to friction of the purge gas through the tube).
</LI>
<LI>The purge gas must not adversely react with the process.
</LI>
<LI>The purge gas must not contaminate the process.
</LI>
<LI>The purge gas must be reasonable in cost, since it will be continuously consumed over time.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
One measurement artifact of a bubble tube system is a slight variation in pressure each time a new bubble breaks away from the end of the tube.  The amount of pressure variation is approximately equal to the hydrostatic pressure of process fluid at a height equal to the diameter of the bubble, which in turn will be approximately equal to the diameter of the bubble tube.  For example, a <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 2.90ex; vertical-align: -0.90ex; " SRC="img54.svg"
 ALT="$1 \over4$"></SPAN> inch diameter dip tube will experience pressure oscillations with a peak-to-peak amplitude of approximately <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 2.90ex; vertical-align: -0.90ex; " SRC="img54.svg"
 ALT="$1 \over4$"></SPAN> inch elevation of process liquid.  The frequency of this pressure oscillation, of course, will be equal to the rate at which individual bubbles escape out the end of the dip tube.

<P>
Usually, this is a small variation when considered in the context of the measured liquid height in the vessel.  A pressure oscillation of approximately <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 2.90ex; vertical-align: -0.90ex; " SRC="img54.svg"
 ALT="$1 \over4$"></SPAN> inch compared to a measurement range of 0 to 10 feet, for example, is only about 0.2% of span.  Modern pressure transmitters have the ability to &ldquo;filter&rdquo; or &ldquo;damp&rdquo; pressure variations over time, which is a useful feature for minimizing the effect such a pressure variation will have on system performance.

A way to help minimize this effect is to place small V-shaped notches at the end of the dip tube, to help bubbles escape at sizes smaller than the tube's diameter:

A very common scenario for liquid level measurement is where the pressure-sensing instrument is not located at the same level as the 0% measurement point.

This means the transmitter's impulse line contains a 30-foot elevation head of ethanol, so the transmitter &ldquo;sees&rdquo; 30 feet of ethanol when the tank is empty and 70 feet of ethanol when the tank is full.

In this example, the transmitter is mounted exactly at the same level as the vessel bottom, but the level measurement range begins at 4 feet up from the vessel bottom.

If the transmitter is elevated above the process connection point, it will most likely &ldquo;see&rdquo; a negative pressure (vacuum) with an empty vessel owing to the pull of liquid in the line leading down from the instrument to the vessel.

The simple and direct relationship between liquid height in a vessel and pressure at the bottom of that vessel is ruined if another source of pressure exists inside the vessel other than hydrostatic (elevation head).  This is virtually guaranteed to be the case if the vessel in question is unvented.  Any gas or vapor pressure accumulation in an enclosed vessel will add to the hydrostatic pressure at the bottom, causing any pressure-sensing instrument to falsely register a high level:

A pressure transmitter has no way of &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; how much of the sensed pressure is due to liquid elevation and how much of it is due to pressure existing in the vapor space above the liquid.  Unless a way can be found to compensate for any non-hydrostatic pressure in the vessel, this extra pressure will be interpreted by the transmitter as additional liquid level.

<P>
Moreover, this error will change as gas pressure inside the vessel changes, so it cannot simply be &ldquo;calibrated away&rdquo; by a static zero shift within the instrument.  The only way to hydrostatically measure liquid level inside an enclosed (non-vented) vessel is to continuously compensate for gas pressure.

Fortunately, the capabilities of a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">differential</SPAN> pressure transmitter make this a simple task.  All we need to do is connect a second impulse line (called a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">compensating leg</SPAN>), from the &ldquo;Low&rdquo; port of the transmitter to the top of the vessel, so the &ldquo;Low&rdquo; side of the transmitter experiences nothing but the gas pressure enclosed by the vessel, while the &ldquo;High&rdquo; side experiences the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">sum</SPAN> of gas and hydrostatic pressures.  Since a differential pressure transmitter responds only to <SPAN  CLASS="textit">differences</SPAN> in pressure between &ldquo;High&rdquo; and &ldquo;Low&rdquo; sides, it will naturally subtract the gas pressure (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 2.42ex; vertical-align: -0.75ex; " SRC="img64.svg"

The amount of gas pressure inside the vessel now becomes completely irrelevant to the transmitter's indication, because its effect is canceled at the differential pressure instrument's sensing element.  If gas pressure inside the vessel were to increase while liquid level remained constant, the pressure sensed at <SPAN  CLASS="textit">both</SPAN> ports of the differential pressure transmitter would increase by the exact same amount, with the pressure <SPAN  CLASS="textit">difference</SPAN> between the &ldquo;high&rdquo; and &ldquo;low&rdquo; ports remaining absolutely constant with the constant liquid level.  This means the instrument's output signal is a representation of hydrostatic pressure only, which represents liquid height (assuming a known liquid density <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.64ex; vertical-align: -0.55ex; " SRC="img23.svg"

Unfortunately, it is common for enclosed vessels to hold condensible vapors, which may over time fill a compensating leg full of liquid.

Gas pressure still cancels due to the differential nature of the pressure transmitter, but now the transmitter's output indicates a difference of hydrostatic pressures between the vessel and the wet leg, rather than just the hydrostatic pressure of the vessel's liquid level.  Fortunately, the hydrostatic pressure generated by the wet leg will be constant, so long as the density of the condensed vapors filling that leg (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.64ex; vertical-align: -0.55ex; " SRC="img70.svg"

We may ensure a constant density of wet leg liquid by intentionally filling that leg with a liquid known to be denser than the densest condensed vapor inside the vessel and non-miscible with the process fluid.

The vessel itself is insulated, and covered in sheet aluminum to protect the thermal insulation from impact and weather-related damage.

An accessory commonly used with non-sealed (non-capillary) &ldquo;wet leg&rdquo; systems is a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">seal pot</SPAN>.  This is a chamber at the top of the wet leg joining the wet leg line with the impulse line to the upper connection point on the process vessel.  This &ldquo;seal pot&rdquo; maintains a small volume of liquid in it to allow for occasional liquid loss during transmitter maintenance procedures without greatly affecting the height of the liquid column in the wet leg:  <A NAME="230"></A>

<P>
Regular operation of the transmitter's three-valve manifold (and drain valve) during routine instrument maintenance inevitably releases some liquid volume from the wet leg.  Without a seal pot, even a small loss of liquid in the wet leg may create a substantial loss in liquid column height within that tube, given the tube's small diameter.  With a seal pot, the (comparatively) large liquid volume held by the pot allows for some liquid loss through the transmitter's manifold without substantially affecting the height of the liquid column within the wet leg.

<P>
Seal pots are standard on level measurement systems for boiler steam drums, where steam readily condenses in the upper impulse tube to naturally form a wet leg.  Although steam will condense over time to refill the wet leg following a loss of water in that leg, the level measurements taken during that re-fill time will be in error.  The presence of a seal pot practically eliminates this error as the steam condenses to replenish the water lost from the pot, since the amount of height change inside the pot due to a small volume loss is trivial compared to the height change in a wet leg lacking a seal pot.

Note that due to the superior density and height of the wet (water) leg, the transmitter <SPAN  CLASS="textit">always</SPAN> sees a negative pressure (pressure on the &ldquo;Low&rdquo; side exceeds pressure on the &ldquo;High&rdquo; side).

With some older differential pressure transmitter designs, this negative pressure was a problem.  Consequently, it is common to see &ldquo;wet leg&rdquo; hydrostatic transmitters installed with the &ldquo;Low&rdquo; port connected to the bottom of the vessel and the &ldquo;High&rdquo; port connected to the compensating leg.

It is vitally important to recognize that any differential pressure transmitter connected as such (for any reason) will respond in reverse fashion to increases in liquid level.  That is to say, as the liquid level in the vessel rises, the transmitter's output signal will <SPAN  CLASS="textit">decrease</SPAN> instead of increase:

Either way of connecting the transmitter to the vessel will suffice for measuring liquid level, so long as the instrumentation receiving the transmitter's signal is properly configured to interpret the signal.  The choice of which way to connect the transmitter to the vessel should be driven by fail-safe system design, which means to design the measurement system such that the most probable system failures &ndash; including broken signal wires &ndash; result in the control system &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; the most dangerous process condition and therefore taking the safest action.

Here we see a vivid example of how several measurements may be inferred from just a few actual process (in this case, pressure) measurements.

The accurate measurement of liquids in storage tanks is not just useful for process operations, but also for conducting business.  Whether the liquid represents raw material purchased from a supplier, or a processed product ready to be pumped out to a customer, both parties have a vested interest in knowing the exact quantity of liquid bought or sold.  Measurement applications such as this are known as <SPAN  CLASS="textit">custody transfer</SPAN>, because they represent the transfer of custody (ownership) of a substance exchanged in a business agreement.  In some instances, both buyer and seller operate and maintain their own custody transfer instrumentation, while in other instances there is only one instrument, the calibration of which validated by a neutral party.  <A NAME="301"></A>

Hydrostatic interface level measurement</A>
</H2>

<P>
Hydrostatic pressure sensors may be used to detect the level of a liquid-liquid interface, if and only if the total height of liquid never drops down into the sensing range of the interface level instrument.  This is critically important because any single hydrostatic-based level instrument cannot discriminate between a changing interface level and a changing total level within the same range, and therefore the latter must be fixed in order to measure the former.

<P>
One way to ensure this condition is to fix the total liquid height to some constant value by using an overflow pipe, and ensuring drain flow is always less than incoming flow (forcing some flow to always go through the overflow pipe).  This strategy naturally lends itself to separation processes, where a mixture of light and heavy liquids are separated by their differing densities:

<P>
<P><!-- MATH
 \begin{displaymath}
\includegraphics{level27.eps}
\end{displaymath}
 -->
</P>
<DIV CLASS="displaymath">
<IMG STYLE="height: 49.16ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img100.svg"
 ALT="$\displaystyle \includegraphics{level27.eps}$">
</DIV><P></P>

<P>
Here we see a practical application for liquid-liquid interface level measurement.  If the goal is to separate two liquids of differing densities from one another, we need only the light liquid to exit out the overflow pipe and only the heavy liquid to exit out the drain pipe.  This means we must control the interface level to stay between those two piping points on the vessel.  If the interface drifts too far up, heavy liquid will be carried out the overflow pipe; and if we let the interface drift too far down, light liquid will flow out of the drain pipe.  The first step in controlling any process variable is to measure that variable, and so here we are faced with the necessity of measuring the interface point between the light and heavy liquids.

<P>
<P>

<P>
Another way to address the problem of varying total liquid height is to use a compensating leg located at a point on the vessel below the total liquid height.  In this example, a transmitter with remote seals is used:

At first, it may seem as though determining the calibration points (lower- and upper-range values: LRV and URV) for a hydrostatic interface level transmitter is impossibly daunting given all the different pressures involved.  A recommended problem-solving technique to apply here is that of a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">thought experiment</SPAN>, where we imagine what the process will &ldquo;look like&rdquo; at lower-range value condition and at the upper-range value condition, drawing two separate illustrations:  <A NAME="308"></A>  <A NAME="309"></A>

Looking at our two &ldquo;thought experiment&rdquo; illustrations, we see that the only difference between the two scenarios is the type of liquid filling that 3-foot region between the LRV and URV marks.  Therefore, the only difference between the transmitter's pressures in those two conditions will be the difference in height multiplied by the difference in density.  Not only is this an easy way for us to quickly calculate the necessary transmitter span, but it also is a way for us to check our previous work: we see that the difference between the LRV and URV pressures is indeed a difference of 11.52 inches water column just as this method predicts.  <A NAME="390"></A>  <A NAME="391"></A>

<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Displacer</SPAN> level instruments exploit <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Archimedes' Principle</SPAN> to detect liquid level by continuously measuring the weight of an object (called the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">displacer</SPAN>) immersed in the process liquid.

In practice a displacer level instrument usually takes the following form.  Process piping in and out of the vessel has been omitted for simplicity &ndash; only the vessel and its displacer level instrument are shown:

<P>
The displacer itself is usually a sealed metal tube, weighted sufficiently so it cannot float in the process liquid.  It hangs within a pipe called a &ldquo;cage&rdquo; connected to the process vessel through two block valves and nozzles.  These two pipe connections ensure the liquid level inside the cage matches the liquid level inside the process vessel, much like a sightglass.

<P>
If liquid level inside the process vessel rises, the liquid level inside the cage rises to match.  This will submerge more of the displacer's volume, causing a buoyant force to be exerted upward on the displacer.  Remember that the displacer is too heavy to float, so it does not &ldquo;bob&rdquo; on the surface of the liquid nor does it rise the same amount as the liquid's level &ndash; rather, it hangs in place inside the cage, becoming &ldquo;lighter<A ID="tex2html14"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot400"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">14</SPAN></SUP></A>&rdquo; as the buoyant force increases.  The weight-sensing mechanism detects this buoyant force when it perceives the displacer becoming lighter, interpreting the decreased (apparent) weight as an increase in liquid level.  The displacer's apparent weight reaches a minimum when it is fully submerged, when the process liquid has reached the 100% point inside the cage.

<P>
It should be noted that static pressure inside the vessel will have negligible effect on a displacer instrument's accuracy.  The only factor that matters is the density of the process fluid, since buoyant force is directly proportional to fluid density (<!-- MATH

The cage pipe is coupled to the process vessel through two block valves, allowing isolation from the process.  A drain valve allows the cage to be emptied of process liquid for instrument service and zero calibration.

Some displacer-type level sensors do not use a cage, but rather hang the displacer element directly in the process vessel.  These are called &ldquo;cageless&rdquo; sensors.  Cageless instruments are of course simpler than cage-style instruments, but they cannot be serviced without de-pressurizing (and perhaps even emptying) the process vessel in which they reside.  They are also susceptible to measurement errors and &ldquo;noise&rdquo; if the liquid inside the vessel is agitated, either by high flow velocities in and out of the vessel, or by the action of motor-turned impellers installed in the vessel to provide thorough mixing of the process liquid(s).  <A NAME="410"></A>

Full-range calibration may be performed by flooding the cage with process liquid (a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">wet</SPAN> calibration), or by suspending the displacer with a string and precise scale (a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">dry</SPAN> calibration), pulling upward on the displacer at just the right amount to simulate buoyancy at 100% liquid level:  <A NAME="413"></A>  <A NAME="414"></A>  <A NAME="415"></A>

Calculation of this buoyant force is a simple matter.  According to Archimedes' Principle, buoyant force is always equal to the weight of the fluid volume displaced.  In the case of a displacer-based level instrument at full range, this usually means the entire volume of the displacer element is submerged in the liquid.  Simply calculate the volume of the displacer (if it is a cylinder, <!-- MATH

Note how important it is to maintain consistency of units!  The liquid density was given in units of pounds per cubic <SPAN  CLASS="textit">foot</SPAN> and the displacer dimensions in <SPAN  CLASS="textit">inches</SPAN>, which would have caused serious problems without a conversion between feet and inches.  In my example work, I opted to convert density into units of pounds per cubic inch, but I could have just as easily converted the displacer dimensions into feet to arrive at a displacer volume in units of cubic feet.

<P>
In a &ldquo;wet&rdquo; calibration, the 5.63 pound buoyant force will be created by the liquid itself, the technician ensuring there is enough liquid inside the cage to simulate a 100% level condition.  In a &ldquo;dry&rdquo; calibration, the buoyant force will be simulated by tension applied upward on the displacer with a hand scale and string, the technician pulling with an upward force of 5.63 pounds to make the instrument &ldquo;think&rdquo; it is sensing 100% liquid level when in fact the displacer is completely dry, hanging in air.

Torque tubes</A>

<P>
An interesting design problem for displacement-type level transmitters is how to transfer the sensed weight of the displacer to the transmitter mechanism while positively sealing process vapor pressure from that same mechanism.  The most common solution to this problem is an ingenious mechanism called a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">torque tube</SPAN>.  Unfortunately, torque tubes can be rather difficult to understand unless you have direct hands-on access to one, and so this section will explore the concept in more detail than is customarily available in reference manuals.  <A NAME="439"></A>

Imagine a solid, horizontal, metal rod with a flange at one end and a perpendicular lever at the other end.  The flange is mounted to a stationary surface, and a weight suspended from the end of the lever.  A dashed-line circle shows where the rod is welded to the center of the flange:

<P>
The downward force of the weight acting on the lever imparts a twisting force (torque) to the rod, causing it to slightly twist along its length.  The more weight hung at the end of the lever, the more the rod will twist<A ID="tex2html16"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot828"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">16</SPAN></SUP></A>.  So long as the torque applied by the weight and lever never exceeds the elastic limit of the rod, the rod will continue to act as a spring.  If we know the &ldquo;spring constant&rdquo; of the rod, and measured its torsional deflection, we can in fact use this slight motion to measure the magnitude of the weight hung at the end of the lever.

<P>
Applied to a displacer-type level instrument, a displacer takes the place of the weight at the lever's end, the torsional deflection of this rod serving to indicate buoyant force.  As liquid rises, buoyant force on the displacer increases, making the displacer seem lighter from the rod's perspective.  The rod's slight motion resulting from this apparent weight change, then, indicates liquid level.

<P>

<P>
Now imagine drilling a long hole through the rod, lengthwise, that almost reaches the end where the lever attaches.  In other words, imagine a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">blind hole</SPAN> through the center of the rod, starting at the flange and ending just shy of the lever:

<P>
The presence of this long hole does not change much about the behavior of the assembly, except perhaps to alter the rod's spring constant.  With less solid metal, the rod will be a weaker spring, and will twist to a greater degree with applied weight at the end of the lever.  More importantly for the purpose of this discussion, though, the long hole transforms the rod into a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">tube</SPAN> with a sealed end.  Instead of a being a &ldquo;torsion bar,&rdquo; the rod is now more properly called a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">torque tube</SPAN>, twisting ever so slightly with applied weight at the end of the lever.

In order to give the torque tube vertical support so it does not sag downward with the applied weight, a supporting <SPAN  CLASS="textit">knife-edge bearing</SPAN> is often placed underneath the end of the lever where it attaches to the torque tube.

The purpose of this smaller-diameter rod is to transfer the twisting motion of the torque tube's far end to a point past the flange where it may be sensed.  Imagine the flange anchored to a vertical wall, while a variable weight tugs downward at the end of the lever.  The torque tube will flex in a twisting motion with the variable force, but now we are able to see just how much it twists by watching the rotation of the smaller rod on the near side of the wall.  The weight and lever may be completely hidden from our view by this wall, but the small rod's twisting motion nevertheless reveals how much the torque tube yields to the force of the weight.

<P>

<P>
We may apply this torque tube mechanism to the task of measuring liquid level in a pressurized vessel by replacing the weight with a displacer, attaching the flange to a nozzle welded to the vessel, and aligning a motion-sensing device with the small rod end to measure its rotation.  As liquid level rises and falls, the apparent weight of the displacer varies, causing the torque tube to slightly twist.  This slight twisting motion is then sensed at the end of the small rod, in an environment isolated from the process fluid pressure.

As you can see from this illustration, the torque tube serves three distinct purposes when applied to a displacer-type level measurement application: (1) to serve as a torsional spring suspending the weight of the displacer, (2) to seal off process fluid pressure from the position-sensing mechanism, and (3) to transfer motion from the far end of the torque tube into the sensing mechanism.  

<P>

<P>
In pneumatic level transmitters, the sensing mechanism used to convert the torque tube's twisting motion into a pneumatic (air pressure) signal is typically of the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">motion-balance</SPAN> design.  The Fisher Level-Trol mechanism, for example, uses a C-shaped bourdon tube with a nozzle at the end to follow a baffle attached to the small rod.  The center of the bourdon tube is aligned with the center of the torque tube.  As the rod rotates, the baffle advances toward the nozzle at the bourdon tube tip, causing backpressure to rise, which in turn causes the bourdon tube to flex.  This flexing draws the nozzle away from the advancing baffle until a balanced condition exists.  Rod motion is therefore balanced by bourdon tube motion, making this a motion-balance pneumatic system:

Displacer level instruments may be used to measure liquid-liquid interfaces just the same as hydrostatic pressure instruments.  One important requirement is that the displacer always be fully submerged (&ldquo;flooded&rdquo;).  If this rule is violated, the instrument will not be able to discriminate between a low (total) liquid level and a low interface level.  This criterion is analogous to the use of compensated-leg differential pressure instruments to measure liquid-liquid interface levels: in order for the instrument to solely respond to changes in interface level and not be &ldquo;fooled&rdquo; by changes in total liquid level, both process connection points must be submerged.  <A NAME="462"></A>

<P>
If the displacer instrument has its own &ldquo;cage,&rdquo; it is important that both pipes connecting the cage to the process vessel (sometimes called &ldquo;nozzles&rdquo;) be submerged.  This ensures the liquid interface inside the cage matches the interface inside the vessel.  If the upper nozzle ever goes dry, the same problem can happen with a caged displacer instrument as with a &ldquo;sightglass&rdquo; level gauge (see section <A HREF="#interface_trouble"><IMG  ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A> beginning on page <A HREF="node2.html#interface_trouble"><IMG  ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A> for a detailed explanation of this problem.).  <A NAME="465"></A>

Determining the calibration points of a displacer-type level instrument for interface applications is relatively easy if the LRV and URV conditions are examined as a pair of &ldquo;thought experiments&rdquo; just as we did with hydrostatic interface level measurement.  First, we imagine what the displacer's condition would &ldquo;look like&rdquo; with the interface at the lower range value, then we imagine a different scenario with the interface at the upper range value.  Sketching illustrations of each scenario is recommended for clarity.  <A NAME="471"></A>  <A NAME="472"></A> 

<P>
Suppose we have a displacer instrument measuring the interface level between two liquids having specific gravities of 0.850 and 1.10, with a displacer length of 30 inches and a displacer diameter of 2.75 inches (radius = 1.375 inches).  Let us further suppose the LRV in this case is where the interface is at the displacer's bottom and the URV is where the interface is at the displacer's top.  The placement of the LRV and URV interface levels at the extreme ends of the displacer's length simplifies our LRV and URV calculations, as the LRV &ldquo;thought experiment&rdquo; will simply be the displacer completely submerged in light liquid and the URV &ldquo;thought experiment&rdquo; will simply be the displacer completely submerged in heavy liquid.

From a historical perspective, hydrostatic and displacement level instruments have a richer pedigree.  These instruments are simpler in nature than echo-based instruments, and were practical long before the advent of modern electronic technology.  Echo-based instruments require precision timing and wave-shaping circuitry, plus sensitive (and rugged!) transceiver elements, demanding a much higher level of technology.  However, modern electronic design and instrument manufacturing practices are making echo-based level instruments more and more practical for industrial applications.  At the time of this writing (2008), it is common practice in some industries to replace old displacer level instruments with guided-wave radar instruments, even in demanding applications operating at high pressures<A ID="tex2html18"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot514"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">18</SPAN></SUP></A>. <A NAME="515"></A>

<P>
Liquid-liquid interfaces may also be measured with some types of echo-based level instruments, most commonly guided-wave radar.  

<P>
The single most important factor to the accuracy of any echo-based level instrument is the speed at which the wave travels en route to the liquid surface and back.  This wave propagation speed is as fundamental to the accuracy of an echo instrument as liquid density is to the accuracy of a hydrostatic or displacer instrument.  So long as this velocity is known and stable, good level measurement accuracy is possible.  Although it is true that the calibration of an echo-based level instrument does not depend on process fluid density for the reason it does in hydrostatic- or displacement-based level instruments, this does not necessarily mean the calibration of an echo-based level instrument remains fixed as process fluid density changes.  The propagation velocity of the wave used in an echo-based level instrument may indeed be subject to change as the process fluids change temperature or composition.  For ultrasonic (sound) echo instruments, the speed of sound is a function of medium density.  Thus, an ultrasonic level transmitter measuring time-of-flight through a vapor above the liquid may drift out of calibration if the speed of sound through that vapor changes substantially, which may happen if the vapor's temperature or pressure happens to change.  If the sound wave time-of-flight is measured while the waves pass through liquid, the calibration may drift if the speed of sound in that liquid changes substantially, which may happen if the liquid's temperature changes.  For radar (radio wave) echo instruments, the speed of radio wave propagation varies according to the dielectric permittivity of the medium.  Permittivity is also affected by changes in density for the fluid medium, and so even radar level instruments may suffer calibration drift with process fluid density changes.

<P>
<P>
To summarize these effects, the speed of sound through any medium is a function of density and bulk modulus (the &ldquo;compressibility&rdquo; of the medium), with density generally being the more variable of the two.  For gases and vapors, this means the speed of sound is strongly affected by changes in gas pressure and/or gas temperature.  For liquids, this means the speed of sound is strongly affected by temperature.  For solids, this means the speed of sound is weakly affected by temperature.  The degree to which the speed of sound will be affected by temperature changes is directly related to the degree the medium's density changes with temperature: solid materials generally expand and contract less than liquids over the same temperature range, thus the strong temperature effect for liquids and the weak temperature effect for solids.  <A NAME="516"></A>  <A NAME="517"></A>

<P>
Radio wave velocity is a function of dielectric permittivity, which is also a function of density.  However, the degree of change in dielectric permittivity resulting from changes in pressure and/or temperature are generally much less than the degree of change in speed of sound for the same media and the same changes in pressure and/or temperature.  This means that &ndash; all other factors being equal &ndash; an echo-based level instrument using radio waves will suffer far less calibration error than an echo-based level instrument using sound waves when process fluid pressure and/or temperature change.  However, it should be noted that process fluid <SPAN  CLASS="textit">composition</SPAN> (i.e. its chemical make-up) may have a strong effect on radio wave propagation, not just on its time-of-flight but also on its ability to produce an adequate echo at the interface between two fluids.

<P>
<P>
Echo-based level instruments may also be &ldquo;fooled&rdquo; by layers of foam resting on top of the liquid, and the liquid-to-liquid interface detection models may have difficulty detecting non-distinct interfaces (such as emulsions).  Irregular structures residing within the vapor space of a vessel (such as access portals, mixer paddles and shafts, ladders, etc.) may wreak havoc with echo-based level instruments by casting false echoes back to the instrument, although this problem may be mitigated by installing guide tubes for the waves to travel in, or using wave probes as in the cases of guided-wave radar instruments.  Liquid streams pouring in to the vessel through the vapor space may similarly cause problems for an echo instrument.  Additionally, all echo-based instruments have <SPAN  CLASS="textit">dead zones</SPAN> where liquid level is too close to the transceiver to be accurately measured or even detected (the echo time-of-flight being too short for the receiving electronics to distinguish from the incident pulse).

<P>
<P>
As you can see, echo-based level instruments have strengths and weaknesses just like any other type of level instrument.  There is no &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; level instrument, but rather a wide array of choices from which the end-user must judiciously select for the particular application in mind.  Beware of sales pitches urging you to buy the &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; level meter!  The wise approach is to first research the underlying physics of the instrument, then determine how strongly its accuracy will be affected by realistic changes in process conditions (e.g. pressure, temperature, composition).

If a sound wave encounters a sudden change in the material's speed of sound, some of that wave's energy will be reflected in the form of another wave in the opposite direction.

Thus, in order for an ultrasonic level transmitter to function reliably, the difference in sonic velocities at the interface between liquid and gas must be large.  Distinct interfaces of liquid and gas almost always exhibit huge differences in their speeds of sound, and so are relatively easy to detect using ultrasonic waves.  Liquids with a heavy layer of foam floating on top are more difficult, since the foam is less dense than the liquid, but considerably denser than the gas above.  A weak echo will be generated at the interface of foam and gas, and another generated at the interface of liquid and foam, with the foam acting to scatter and dissipate much of the second echo's energy.  <A NAME="529"></A>  <A NAME="530"></A>

As mentioned previously, the calibration of an ultrasonic level transmitter depends on the speed of sound through the medium between the transducer and the interface.  For top-mounted transducers, this is the speed of sound through the air (or vapor) over the liquid, since this is the medium through which the incident and reflected wave travel time is measured.  For bottom-mounted transducers, this is the speed of sound through the liquid.  In either case, to ensure good accuracy, one must make sure the speed of sound through the &ldquo;timed&rdquo; travel path remains reasonably constant (or else compensate for changes in the speed of sound through that medium by use of temperature or pressure measurements and a compensating algorithm).

<P>

<P>
Ultrasonic level instruments enjoy the advantage of being able to measure the height of solid materials such as powders and grains stored in vessels, not just liquids.  Again, the fundamental criterion for detecting a level of material is that the speeds of sound through the upper and lower materials must differ (the greater the difference, the stronger the echo).  A unique challenge to solids measurement is the distinct possibility of uneven material profiles.  A classic problem encountered when measuring the level of a powdered or granular material in a vessel is the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">angle of repose</SPAN> formed by the material as a result of being fed into the vessel at one point:  <A NAME="543"></A>  <A NAME="544"></A>

This angled surface is difficult for an ultrasonic device to detect because it tends to scatter the sound waves laterally instead of reflecting them strongly back toward the instrument.  However, even if the scattering problem is not significant, there still remains the problem of interpretation: what is the instrument actually measuring?  The detected level near the vessel wall will certainly register less than at the center, but the level detected mid-way between the vessel wall and vessel center may not be an accurate average of those two heights.  Moreover, this angle may decrease over time if mechanical vibrations cause the material to &ldquo;flow&rdquo; and tumble from center to edge.

<P>
For this reason, solids storage measurement applications demanding high accuracy generally use other techniques, such as weight-based measurement (see section <A HREF="#Weight-based_level"><IMG  ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A> for more information) or three-dimensional scanning (see section <A HREF="#Storage_tank_characterization"><IMG  ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A> for more information).

The fundamental difference between a radar instrument and an ultrasonic instrument is the type of wave used: radio waves instead of sound waves.  Radio waves are electromagnetic in nature (comprised of alternating electric and magnetic fields), and very high frequency (in the microwave frequency range &ndash; GHz).  Sound waves are <SPAN  CLASS="textit">mechanical</SPAN> vibrations (transmitted from molecule to molecule in a fluid or solid substance) and of much lower frequency (tens or hundreds of kilohertz &ndash; still too high for a human being to detect as a tone) than radio waves.

Non-contact radar devices suffer much more signal loss than guided-wave radar devices, due to the natural tendency of electromagnetic radiation to disperse over space.  Waveguides combat this signal loss by channeling the radio energy along a straight-line path.  Probes used in guided-wave radar instruments may be single metal rods, parallel pairs of metal rods, or a coaxial metal rod-and-tube structure.  Single-rod probes suffer the greatest energy losses, while coaxial probes excel at guiding the microwave energy to the liquid interface and back.  However, single-rod probes are much more tolerant of process fouling than two-rod or (especially) coaxial probes, where sticky masses of viscous liquid and/or solid matter cling to the probe.  Such fouling deposits, if severe enough, will cause electromagnetic wave reflections that &ldquo;look&rdquo; to the transmitter like the reflection from an actual liquid level or interface.

<P>

<P>
Non-contact radar instruments rely on antennas to direct microwave energy into the vessel, and to receive the echo (return) energy.  These antennas must be kept clean and dry, which may be a problem if the liquid being measured emits condensible vapors.  For this reason, non-contact radar instruments are often separated from the vessel interior by means of a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">dielectric window</SPAN> (made of some substance such as plastic that is relatively &ldquo;transparent&rdquo; to electromagnetic waves yet acts as an effective vapor barrier):

As mentioned previously, the calibration of any echo-based level transmitter depends on knowing the speed of wave propagation through the medium separating the instrument from the process fluid interface.  For radar transmitters sensing a single liquid below a gas or vapor, this speed is the speed of light through that gas or vapor space, which we know to be a function of electrical permittivity.

<P>
The relative permittivity of air at standard pressure and temperature is very nearly unity (1).  This means the speed of light in air under atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature will very nearly be the same as it is for a perfect vacuum (<!-- MATH

This formula is based on the principle that bulk permittivity is a function of density.  We may see why this is by running a &ldquo;thought experiment&rdquo; in which a sample of gas becomes denser.  As gas density increases, more gas molecules will become packed into the same volume of space.  If each gas molecule's permittivity is greater than the permittivity of empty space, then having more of those gas molecules present will mean the permittivity of that volume increases.  Greater permittivity, of course, decreases the velocity of light through the gas, and thereby affects the calibration of the radar instrument.   <A NAME="588"></A>  <A NAME="589"></A>

<P>
Relating this concept to pressure and temperature variations in the gas, we can see that the permittivity of a gas increases with increasing pressure (by increasing gas density), and decreases with increasing temperature (by decreasing gas density).  This means the speed of light through a gas decreases with increasing pressure, and increases with increasing temperature.  For radar level instruments operating in gas environments subject to significant pressure and temperature (i.e. density) variations, the consequent variations in the speed of light through that gas will compromise the instrument's accuracy.

For any echo-based level instruments, the necessary condition for an echo to occur is that the wave encounters a sudden change in propagation velocity.  With ultrasonic level instruments, the velocity of propagation for the sound wave depends on both the densities and the bulk moduli (incompressibilities) of the substances, so that a sudden change in either parameter from one substance to another will cause the sound wave to reflect.  With radar level instruments, the necessary condition for wave reflection is a sudden change in dielectric permittivity<A ID="tex2html27"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot842"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">27</SPAN></SUP></A> (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.19ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img180.svg"
 ALT="$\epsilon$"></SPAN>).  When an electromagnetic wave encounters a sudden change in dielectric permittivity, some of that wave's energy will be reflected in the form of another wave traveling the opposite direction, while the balance of the wave's energy continues forward to propagate into the new material.  The strength of the reflected signal depends on how greatly the two materials' permittivities differ:

This same principle explains reflected signals in copper transmission lines as well.  Any discontinuities (sudden changes in characteristic impedance) along the length of a transmission line will reflect a portion of the electrical signal's power back to the source.  In a transmission line, continuities may be formed by pinches, breaks, or short-circuits.  In a radar level measurement system, any sudden change in electrical permittivity is a discontinuity that reflects some of the incident wave energy back to the source.  Thus, radar level instruments function best when there is a large difference in permittivity between the two substances at the interface.  As shown in the previous illustration, air and water meet this criterion, having an 80:1 permittivity ratio.

This means well over half the incident power reflects off the air/water interface to form a strong echo signal, with the remaining 0.362 (36.2%) of the wave's power traveling through the air-water interface and propagating into water.  If the liquid in question is gasoline rather than water (having a rather low relative permittivity value of approximately 2), the power reflection ratio will only be 0.0294 (2.94%) or <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.88ex; vertical-align: -0.29ex; " SRC="img205.svg"

The longer version of the power reflection factor formula suggests liquid-liquid interfaces should be detectable using radar, and indeed they are.  All that is needed is a sufficiently large difference in permittivity between the two liquids to create a strong enough echo to reliably detect.  Liquid-liquid interface level measurement with radar works best when the upper liquid has a substantially lesser permittivity value than the lower liquid<A ID="tex2html28"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot849"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">28</SPAN></SUP></A>.  A layer of hydrocarbon oil on top of water (or any aqueous solution such as an acid or a caustic) is a good candidate for guided-wave radar level measurement.  An example of a liquid-liquid interface that would be very difficult for a radar instrument to detect is water (<!-- MATH
 $\epsilon_r \approx 80$

<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 2.03ex; vertical-align: -0.45ex; " SRC="img203.svg"

If the radar instrument uses a digital network protocol to communicate information with a host system (such as HART or any number of &ldquo;fieldbus&rdquo; standards), it may perform as a multi-variable transmitter, transmitting <SPAN  CLASS="textit">both</SPAN> the interface level measurement and the total liquid level measurement simultaneously.  This capability is rather unique to guided-wave radar transmitters, and is very useful in some processes because it eliminates the need for multiple instruments measuring multiple levels.  <A NAME="607"></A>  <A NAME="608"></A> <A NAME="609"></A>

One reason why a lesser-<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.19ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img180.svg"
 ALT="$\epsilon$"></SPAN> fluid above a greater-<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.19ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img180.svg"
 ALT="$\epsilon$"></SPAN> fluid is easier to detect than the inverse is due to the necessity of the signal having to travel through a gas-liquid interface above the liquid-liquid interface.  With gases and vapors having such small <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.19ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img180.svg"
 ALT="$\epsilon$"></SPAN> values, the signal would have to pass through the gas-liquid interface first in order to reach the liquid-liquid interface.  This gas-liquid interface, having the greatest difference in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.19ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img180.svg"
 ALT="$\epsilon$"></SPAN> values of any interface within the vessel, will be <SPAN  CLASS="textit">most</SPAN> reflective to electromagnetic energy <SPAN  CLASS="textit">in both directions</SPAN>.  Thus, only a small portion of the incident wave will ever reach the liquid-liquid interface, and a similarly small portion of the wave reflected off the liquid-liquid interface (which itself is a fraction of the forward wave power that made it through the gas-liquid interface on its way down) will ever make it through the gas-liquid interface on its way <SPAN  CLASS="textit">back up</SPAN> to the instrument.

As you can see in the illustration, the difference in power received back at the instrument is nearly two to one, just from the upper liquid having the lesser of two identical <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.19ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img180.svg"
 ALT="$\epsilon$"></SPAN> values.  Of course, in real life you do not have the luxury of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">choosing</SPAN> which liquid will go on top of the other (this being determined by fluid density), but you do have the luxury of choosing the appropriate liquid-liquid interface level measurement technology, and as you can see here certain orientations of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.19ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img180.svg"
 ALT="$\epsilon$"></SPAN> values are less detectable with radar than others.

<P>
Another factor working against radar as a liquid-liquid interface measurement technology for interfaces where the upper liquid has a greater dielectric constant is that fact that many high-<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.19ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img180.svg"
 ALT="$\epsilon$"></SPAN> liquids are aqueous in nature, and water readily dissipates microwave energy.  This fact is exploited in microwave ovens, where microwave radiation excites water molecules in the food, dissipating energy in the form of heat.  For a radar-based level measurement system consisting of gas/vapor over water over some other (heavier) liquid, the echo signal will be extremely weak because the signal must pass through the &ldquo;lossy&rdquo; water layer <SPAN  CLASS="textit">twice</SPAN> before it returns to the radar instrument.

<P>
Electromagnetic energy losses are important to consider in radar level instrumentation, even when the detected interface is simply gas (or vapor) over liquid.  The power reflection factor formula only predicts the ratio of reflected power to incident power <SPAN  CLASS="textit">at an interface of substances</SPAN>.  Just because an air-water interface reflects 63.8% of the incident power does not mean 63.8% of the incident power will actually return to the transceiver antenna!  Any dissipative losses between the transceiver and the interface(s) of concern will weaken the signal, to the point where it may become difficult to distinguish from noise.

<P>
Another important factor in maximizing reflected power is the degree to which the microwaves disperse on their way to the liquid interface(s) and back to the transceiver.  Guided-wave radar instruments receive a far greater percentage of their transmitted power than non-contact radar instruments because the metal probe used to guide the microwave signal pulses help prevent the waves from spreading (and therefore weakening) throughout the liquids as they propagate.  In other words, the probe functions as a transmission line to direct and focus the microwave energy, ensuring a straight path from the instrument into the liquid, and a straight echo return path from the liquid back to the instrument.  This is why guided-wave radar is the only practical radar technology for measuring liquid-liquid interfaces.

<P>
<P>
A critically important factor in accurate level measurement using radar instruments is that the dielectric permittivity of every substance lying between the radar instrument and the interface of interest be accurately known.  The reason for this is rooted in the dependence of electromagnetic wave propagation velocity to relative permittivity.

In the case of a single-liquid application where nothing but gas or vapor exists above the liquid, the permittivity of that gas or vapor must be precisely known.  In the case of a two-liquid interface with gas or vapor above, the relative permittivities of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">both</SPAN> gas and upper liquids must be accurately known in order to accurately measure the liquid-liquid interface.  Changes in dielectric constant value of the medium or media through which the microwaves must travel and echo will cause the microwave radiation to propagate at different velocities.  Since all radar measurement is based on time-of-flight through the media separating the radar transceiver from the echo interface, changes in wave velocity through this media will affect the amount of time required for the wave to travel from the transceiver to the echo interface, and reflect back to the transceiver.  Therefore, changes in dielectric constant are relevant to the accuracy of any radar level measurement<A ID="tex2html30"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot623"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">30</SPAN></SUP></A>.  

<P>
Factors influencing the dielectric constant of gases include pressure and temperature, which means the accuracy of a radar level instrument will vary as gas pressure and/or gas temperature vary!  This is often referred to as the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">gas phase effect</SPAN>.  Whether or not this variation is substantial enough to consider for any application depends on the desired measurement accuracy and the degree of permittivity change from one pressure/temperature extreme to another.  In no case should a radar instrument be considered for any level measurement application unless the dielectric constant value(s) of the upper media are precisely known.  This is analogous to the dependence on liquid density that hydrostatic level instruments face.  It is futile to attempt level measurement based on hydrostatic pressure if liquid density is unknown or widely varying, and it is just as futile to attempt level measurement based on radar if the dielectric constants are unknown<A ID="tex2html31"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot625"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">31</SPAN></SUP></A> or varies widely.  <A NAME="626"></A>

<P>
One way to compensate for the gas phase effect in radar level instruments is to equip the instrument with a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">reference probe</SPAN> of fixed length oriented in such a way that its entire length is always above the liquid level (i.e. it only senses gas).  If the permittivity of the gas is constant, the echo time along this reference probe will remain the same.  If, however, the gas permittivity changes, the reference probe's echo time will correspondingly change, allowing the instrument's microprocessor to measure gas permittivity and consequently adjust calculations for liquid level based on this known change.  This concept is analogous to the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">compensating probe</SPAN> sometimes used in capacitive level sensors, designed to measure fluid permittivity so as to compensate for any changes in this critical parameter.  <A NAME="629"></A>

As with ultrasonic level instruments, radar level instruments can sense the level of solid substances in vessels (e.g. powders and granules) and not just liquids.

Pulse <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">P1</SPAN> is the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">reference</SPAN> or <SPAN  CLASS="textit">fiducial</SPAN> pulse, resulting from the change in dielectric permittivity between the extended &ldquo;neck&rdquo; of the probe (connecting the transmitter to the probe tube) and the coaxial probe itself.

Several <SPAN  CLASS="textit">threshold</SPAN> settings determine how the transmitter categorizes each received pulse.  Threshold <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">T1</SPAN> for this particular radar instrument defines which pulse is the reference (fiducial).  Thus, the first echo in time to exceed the value of threshold <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">T1</SPAN> is interpreted by the instrument to be the reference point.  Threshold <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">T2</SPAN> defines the upper product level, so the first echo in time to exceed this threshold value is interpreted as the vapor/liquid interface point.  Threshold <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">T3</SPAN> for this particular transmitter is used to define the echo generated by a liquid-liquid interface.  However, threshold <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">T3</SPAN> does not appear in this echo plot because the interface measurement option was disabled during this experiment.  The last threshold, <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">T4</SPAN>, defines the end-of-probe detection.  Set at a negative value (just like the reference threshold <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">T1</SPAN>), threshold <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">T4</SPAN> looks for the first pulse in time to exceed that value and interprets that pulse as the one resulting from the signal reaching the probe's end.

<P>
All along the echo curve you can see weak echo signals showing up as bumps.  These echoes may be caused by discontinuities along the probe (solid deposits, vent holes, centering spacers, etc.), discontinuities in the process liquid (suspended solids, emulsions, etc.), or even discontinuities in the surrounding process vessel (for non-coaxial probes which exhibit varying degrees of sensitivity to surrounding objects).  A challenge in configuring a radar level transmitter is to set the threshold values such that &ldquo;false&rdquo; echoes are not interpreted as real liquid or interface levels.

<P>
A simple way to eliminate false echoes near the reference point is to set a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">null zone</SPAN> where any echoes are ignored.  The upper null zone (UNZ) setting on the Rosemount 3301 radar level transmitter whose screen capture image was shown previously was set to zero, meaning it would be sensitive to any and all echoes near the reference point.  If a false echo from a tank nozzle or some other discontinuity near the probe's entry point into the process vessel created a measurement problem, the upper null zone (UNZ) value could be set just beyond that point so the false echo would not be interpreted as a liquid level echo, regardless of the threshold value for <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">T2</SPAN>.  A &ldquo;null zone&rdquo; is sometimes referred to as a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">hold-off distance</SPAN>.  <A NAME="656"></A>  <A NAME="657"></A>

<P>
Some radar level instruments allow thresholds to be set as curves themselves rather than straight lines.  Thus, thresholds may be set high during certain periods along the horizontal (time/distance) axis to ignore false echoes, and set low during other periods to capture legitimate echo signals.

<P>
<P>

<P>
Regardless of how null zones and thresholds are set for any guided-wave radar level transmitter, the technician must be aware of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">transition zones</SPAN> near each end of the probe.  Measurements of liquid level or interface level within these zones may not be accurate or even linearly responsive.  Thus, it is strongly advised to range the instrument in such a way that the lower- and upper-range values (LRV and URV) lie between the transition zones:  <A NAME="659"></A>

Laser level measurement</A>
</H2>

<P>
The least-common form of echo-based level measurement is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">laser</SPAN>, which uses pulses of laser light reflected off the surface of a liquid to detect the liquid level.  Perhaps the most limiting factor with laser measurement is the necessity of having a sufficiently reflective surface for the laser light to &ldquo;echo&rdquo; off of.  Many liquids are not reflective enough for this to be a practical measurement technique, and the presence of dust or thick vapors in the space between the laser and the liquid will disperse the light, weakening the light signal and making the level more difficult to detect.

<P>
However, lasers have been applied with great success in measuring distances between objects.  Applications of this technology include motion control on large machines, where a laser points at a moving reflector, the laser's electronics calculating distance to the reflector based on the amount of time it takes for the laser &ldquo;echo&rdquo; to return.  The advent of mass-produced, precision electronics has made this technology practical and affordable for many applications.  At the time of this writing (2008), it is even possible for the average American consumer to purchase laser &ldquo;tape measures&rdquo; for use in building construction.

Magnetostrictive level measurement</A>

<P>
<A ID="magnetostrictive_level"></A>
<P>
A variation on the theme of echo-based level instruments, where the level of some process material in a vessel is measured by timing the travel of a wave between the instrument and the material interface, is one applied to float-type instruments: <SPAN  CLASS="textit">magnetostriction</SPAN>.  <A NAME="667"></A>

<P>
In a magnetostrictive level instrument, liquid level is sensed by a lightweight, donut-shaped float containing a magnet.  This float is centered around a long metal rod called a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">waveguide</SPAN>, hung vertically in the process vessel (or hung vertically in a protective cage like the type used for displacement-style level instruments) so that the float may rise and fall with process liquid level.  The magnetic field from the float's magnet at that point, combined with the magnetic field produced by an electric current pulse periodically sent through the rod, generates a torsional stress pulse<A ID="tex2html33"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot853"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">33</SPAN></SUP></A> at the precise location of the float.  This torsional (twisting) stress travels at the speed of sound through the rod toward either end.  At the bottom end is a dampener device designed to absorb the mechanical wave<A ID="tex2html34"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot854"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">34</SPAN></SUP></A>.  

<P>
One might argue that a magnetostrictive instrument is not an &ldquo;echo&rdquo; technology in the strictest sense of the word.  Unlike ultrasonic, radar, and laser instruments, we are not reflecting a wave off a discontinuous interface between materials.  Instead, a mechanical wave (pulse) is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">generated</SPAN> at the location of a magnetic float in response to an electrical pulse.  However, the principle of measuring distance by the wave's travel time is the same.  At the top end of the rod (above the process liquid level) is a sensor and electronics package designed to detect the arrival of the mechanical wave.  A precision electronic timing circuit measures the time elapsed between the electric current pulse (called the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">interrogation pulse</SPAN>) and the received mechanical pulse.  So long as the speed of sound through the metal waveguide rod remains fixed, the time delay is strictly a function of distance between the float and the sensor, which we already know is called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">ullage</SPAN>.  <A NAME="676"></A>

The design of this instrument is reminiscent of a guided-wave radar transmitter, where a metal <SPAN  CLASS="textit">waveguide</SPAN> hangs vertically into the process liquid, guiding a pulse to the sensor head where the sensitive electronic components are located.  The major difference here is that the pulse is a sonic vibration traveling through the metal of the waveguide rod, not an electromagnetic pulse as is the case with radar.  Like all sound waves, the torsional pulse in a magnetostriction-based level transmitter is much slower-traveling<A ID="tex2html36"

It is even possible to measure liquid-liquid interfaces with magnetostrictive instruments.  If the waveguide is equipped with a float of such density that it floats on the interface between the two liquids (i.e. the float is denser than the light liquid and less dense than the heavy liquid), the sonic pulse generated in the waveguide by that float's position will represent interface level.  Magnetostrictive instruments may even be equipped with two floats: one to sense a liquid-liquid interface, and the other to sense the liquid-vapor interface, so that it may measure both the interface and total levels simultaneously just like a guided-wave radar transmitter:

With such an instrument, each electrical &ldquo;interrogation&rdquo; pulse returns <SPAN  CLASS="textit">two</SPAN> sonic pulses to the sensor head: the first pulse representing the total liquid level (upper, light float) and the second pulse representing the interface level (lower, heavy float).  If the instrument has digital communication capability (e.g. HART, FOUNDATION Fieldbus, Profibus, etc.), both levels may be reported to the control system over the same wire pair, making it a &ldquo;multivariable&rdquo; instrument. 

<P>
<P>
Perhaps the greatest limitation of magnetostrictive level instruments is mechanical interference between the float and the rod.  In order for the magnetostrictive effect to be strong, the magnet inside the float must be in close proximity to the rod.  This means the inside diameter of the donut-shaped float must fit closely to the outside diameter of the waveguide.  Any fouling of the waveguide's or float's surfaces by suspended solids, sludge, or other semi-solid materials may cause the float to bind and therefore not respond to changes in liquid level.

Weight-based measurements are often employed where the true mass of a quantity must be ascertained, rather than the level.  So long as the material's density is a known constant, the relationship between weight and level for a vessel of constant cross-sectional area will be linear and predictable.  Constant density is not always the case, especially for solid materials, and so weight-based inference of vessel level may be problematic.

<P>
In applications where batch mass is more important than height (level), weight-based measurement is often the preferred method for portioning batches.  You will find weight-based portion measurements used frequently in the food processing industries (e.g. consistently filling bags and boxes with product), and also for custody transfer of certain materials (e.g. coal and metal ore).

<P>

One very important caveat for weight-based level instruments is to isolate the vessel from any external mechanical stresses generated by pipes or machinery.

Stress relief is very important because any forces acting upon the storage vessel will be interpreted by the load cells as more or less material stored in the vessel.  The only way to ensure that the load cell's measurement is a direct indication of material held inside the vessel is to ensure that no other forces act upon the vessel except the gravitational weight of the material.

<P>
A similar concern for weight-based batch measurement is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">vibration</SPAN> produced by machinery surrounding (or on) the vessel.  Vibration is nothing more than oscillatory <SPAN  CLASS="textit">acceleration</SPAN>, and the acceleration of any mass produces a reaction force (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 1.77ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img224.svg"

An interesting problem associated with load cell measurement of vessel weight arises if there are ever electric currents traveling through the load cell(s).  This is not a normal state of affairs, but it can happen if maintenance workers incorrectly attach arc welding equipment to the support structure of the vessel, or if certain electrical equipment mounted on the vessel such as lights or motors develop ground faults.  The electronic amplifier circuits interpreting a load cell's resistance will detect voltage drops created by such currents, interpreting them as changes in load cell resistance and therefore as changes in material level.  Sufficiently large currents may even cause permanent damage to load cells, as is often the case when the currents in question are generated by arc welding equipment.

<P>
<P>
A variation on this theme is the so-called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">hydraulic load cell</SPAN> which is a piston-and-cylinder mechanism designed to translate vessel weight directly into hydraulic (liquid) pressure.  A normal pressure transmitter then measures the pressure developed by the load cell and reports it as material weight stored in the vessel.

Permittivity of the process substance is a critical variable in the non-conductive style of capacitance level probe, and so good accuracy may be obtained with this kind of instrument only if the process material permittivity is accurately known.

This gives the instrument a way to continuously measure material permittivity, which it then uses to calculate the level of that material in the vessel based on the capacitance of the main probe.  The inclusion of a compensating probe to measure and compensate for changes in permittivity is analogous to the inclusion of a third pressure transmitter in a hydrostatic <SPAN  CLASS="textit">tank expert</SPAN> system to continuously measure and compensate for density.  It is a way to correct for changes in the one remaining system variable that is not related to changes in level.  <A NAME="720"></A>  <A NAME="721"></A>

<P>
<P>
Capacitive level instruments may be used to measure the level of solids (powders and granules) in addition to liquids.  In these applications, the material in question is almost always non-conductive, and therefore the permittivity of the substance becomes a factor in measurement accuracy.  This can be problematic, as moisture content variations in the solid may greatly affect permittivity, as can variations in granule size.  Compensating probes may not be very useful, either, because their location (at the bottom of the vessel) may not expose them to the same degree of material granularity and moisture content experienced by the main probe.

<P>
Capacitive level instruments are generally found in applications where precision is not important.  These instruments tend to suffer from errors arising from changes in process substance permittivity, changes in process vapor-space permittivity, and errors caused by stray capacitance in probe cables.

 ALT="$\alpha$"></SPAN>), <SPAN  CLASS="textit">beta particles</SPAN> (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 2.25ex; vertical-align: -0.55ex; " SRC="img231.svg"

 ALT="$n$"></SPAN>).  Alpha particles are helium nuclei (2 protons bound together with 2 neutrons) ejected at high velocity from the nuclei of certain decaying atoms.  They are easy to detect, but have very little penetrating power and so are not used for industrial level measurement.  Beta particles are electrons<A ID="tex2html41"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot857"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">41</SPAN></SUP></A> ejected at high velocity from the nuclei of certain decaying atoms.  Like alpha particles, though, they have little penetrating power and so are not used for industrial level measurement.  Gamma rays are electromagnetic in nature (like X-rays and light waves) and have great penetrating power.  Neutron radiation also penetrates metal very effectively, but is attenuated and scattered by any substance containing hydrogen (e.g. water, hydrocarbons, and many other industrial fluids), which makes it almost ideal for detecting the presence of a great many process fluids.  These latter two forms of radiation (gamma rays and neutrons) are the most common in industrial measurement, with gamma rays used in through-vessel applications and neutrons typically used in backscatter applications.  <A NAME="730"></A>  <A NAME="731"></A>  <A NAME="732"></A>  <A NAME="733"></A>  <A NAME="734"></A>  <A NAME="735"></A>  <A NAME="736"></A>  <A NAME="737"></A>  <A NAME="738"></A>  <A NAME="739"></A>

Nuclear radiation sources consist of radioactive samples contained in a shielded box.  The sample itself is a small piece of radioactive substance encased in a double-wall stainless steel cladding, typically resembling a medicinal pill in size and shape.  The specific type and quantity of radioactive source material depends on the nature and intensity of radiation required for the application.  The basic rule here is that less is better: the smallest source capable of performing the measurement task is the best one for the application.

<P>
Common source types for gamma-ray applications are Cesium-137 and Cobalt-60.  The numbers represent the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">atomic mass</SPAN> of each isotope: the sum total of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of each atom.  These isotopes' nuclei are unstable, decaying over time to become different elements (Barium-137 and Nickel-60, respectively).  Cobalt-60 has a relatively short half-life<A ID="tex2html42"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot858"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">42</SPAN></SUP></A> of 5.3 years, whereas Cesium-137 has a much longer half-life of 30 years.  This means radiation-based sensors using Cesium will be more stable over time (i.e. less calibration drift) than sensors using Cobalt.  The trade-off is that Cobalt emits more powerful gamma rays than Cesium, which makes it better suited to applications where the radiation must penetrate thick process vessels or travel long distances (across wide process vessels).  <A NAME="745"></A>

<P>

<P>
One of the most effective methods of shielding against gamma ray radiation is with very dense substances such as lead or concrete.  This is why the source boxes holding gamma-emitting radioactive pellets are lined with lead, so the radiation escapes only in the direction intended:

Radioactive sources naturally emit radiation, requiring no source of energy such as electricity to do their job.  As such, they are &ldquo;always-on&rdquo; devices and may be locked out for testing and maintenance only by dropping a lead <SPAN  CLASS="textit">shutter</SPAN> over the &ldquo;window&rdquo; of the box.  The lever actuating the shutter typically has provisions for lock-out/tag-out (LOTO) so a maintenance person may place a padlock on the lever and prevent anyone else from &ldquo;turning on&rdquo; the source during maintenance.  For point-level (level switch) applications, the source shutter acts as a simple simulator for either a full vessel (in the case of a through-vessel installation) or an empty vessel (in the case of a backscatter installation).  A full vessel may be simulated for neutron backscatter instruments by placing a sheet of plastic (or other hydrogen-rich substance) between the source box and the process vessel wall.  <A NAME="748"></A>  <A NAME="749"></A>  <A NAME="750"></A>

The detector for a radiation-based instrument is by far the most complex and expensive component of the system.  Many different detector designs exist, the most common at the time of this writing being <SPAN  CLASS="textit">ionization chambers</SPAN> such as the Geiger-Muller (G-M) tube.  In such devices, a thin metal wire centered in a metal cylinder sealed and filled with inert gas is energized with high voltage DC.  Any ionizing radiation such as alpha, beta, or gamma radiation entering the tube causes gas molecules to ionize, allowing a pulse of electric current to travel between the wire and tube wall.  A sensitive electronic circuit detects and counts these pulses, with a greater pulse rate corresponding to a greater intensity of detected radiation.  <A NAME="752"></A>  <A NAME="753"></A>

Geiger-style radiation detectors used as part of permanently-installed level measurement systems are housed in rugged housings, internally similar to the portable G-M tube shown in the photograph but designed for the rigors of continuous use in harsh industrial environments.

<P>
Neutron radiation is notoriously difficult to electronically detect, since neutrons are non-ionizing.  Ionization tubes specifically made for neutron radiation detection are typically based on the Geiger-Muller design, but using tubes filled with special substances known to react with neutron radiation to produce (secondary) ionizing radiation.  One example of such a detector is the so-called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">fission chamber</SPAN>, which is an ionization chamber lined with a fissile material such as uranium-235 (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 2.03ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img237.svg"
 ALT="$^{235}$"></SPAN>U).  When a neutron enters the chamber and is captured by a fissile nucleus, that nucleus undergoes fission (splits into separate pieces) with a subsequent emission of gamma rays and charged particles, which are then detected by ionization in the chamber.  Another variation on this theme is to fill an ionization tube with boron trifluoride gas.  When a boron-10 (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 2.03ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img238.svg"
 ALT="$^{10}$"></SPAN>B) nucleus captures a neutron, it transmutates into lithium-7 (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 2.03ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img239.svg"
 ALT="$^{7}$"></SPAN>Li) and ejects an alpha particle and several beta particles, both of which cause detectable ionization in the chamber. <A NAME="763"></A>

The accuracy of radiation-based level instruments varies with the stability of process fluid density, vessel wall coating, source decay rates, and detector drift.  The multitude of error variables in radiation-based level measurement is one reason why they are more typically found as point-level (i.e. level switch) devices rather than continuous level (i.e. transmitter) measurement applications.  

<P>
With their generally poor accuracy and the additional need for NRC (Nuclear Regulatory Commission) licensing to operate such instruments at an industrial facility, radiation instruments are typically used where no other instrument is practical.  Examples include the level measurement of highly corrosive or toxic process fluids where penetrations into the vessel must be minimized and where piping requirements make weight-based measurement impractical (e.g. hydrocarbon/acid separators in alkylation processes in the oil refining industry), as well as processes where the internal conditions of the vessel are too physically violent for any instrument to survive (e.g. delayed coking vessels in the oil refining industry, where the coke is &ldquo;drilled&rdquo; out of the vessel by a high-pressure water jet).  <A NAME="764"></A>  <A NAME="765"></A>

Disturbances in the liquid tend to complicate liquid level measurement.  These disturbances may result from liquid introduced into a vessel above the liquid level (splashing into the liquid's surface), the rotation of agitator paddles, and/or turbulent flows from mixing pumps.  Any source of turbulence for the liquid surface (or liquid-liquid interface) is especially problematic for echo-type level sensors, which <SPAN  CLASS="textit">only</SPAN> sense interfaces between vapors and liquids, or liquids and liquids.  

<P>
If it is not possible to eliminate disturbances inside the process vessel, a relatively simple accessory one may add to the process vessel is a vertical length of pipe called a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">stilling well</SPAN>.  To understand the principle of a stilling well, first consider the application of a hydraulic oil reservoir where we wish to continuously measure oil level.  The oil flow in and out of this reservoir will cause problems for the displacer element: <A NAME="769"></A>

A section of vertical pipe installed in the reservoir around the displacer will serve as a shield to all the turbulence in the rest of the reservoir.  The displacer element will no longer be subject to a horizontal blast of oil entering the reservoir, nor any wave action to make it bob up and down.  This section of pipe <SPAN  CLASS="textit">quiets</SPAN>, or <SPAN  CLASS="textit">stills</SPAN>, the oil surrounding the displacer, making it easier to measure oil level:

Stilling wells may be used in conjunction with many types of level instruments: floats, displacers, ultrasonic, radar, and laser to name a few.  If the process application necessitates liquid-liquid interface measurement, however, the stilling well must be properly installed to ensure the interface level inside the well match the interface levels in the rest of the vessel.  Consider this example of using a stilling well in conjunction with a tape-and-float system for interface measurement:

<P>
In the left-hand installation where the stilling well is completely submerged, the interface levels will always match.  In the right-hand installation where the top of the stilling well extends above the total liquid level, however, the two levels may not always match.  

<P>

<P>
This potential problem for the non-submerged stilling well is graphically illustrated here:

The problem here is analogous to what we see with sightglass-style level gauges: interfaces may be reliably indicated if and only if both ends of the sightglass are submerged (see section <A HREF="#interface_trouble"><IMG  ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A> beginning on page <A HREF="node2.html#interface_trouble"><IMG  ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A> for an illustrated explanation of the problem). 

<P>

<P>
If it is not possible or practical to ensure complete submersion of the stilling well, an alternative technique is to drill holes or cut slots in the well to allow interface levels to equalize inside and outside of the well tube:

Such equalization ports are commonly found as a standard design feature on coaxial probes for guided-wave radar level transmitters, where the outer tube of the coaxial transmission line acts as a sort of stilling well for the fluid.  Coaxial probes are typically chosen for liquid-liquid interface radar measurement applications because they do the best job of preventing dispersion of the electromagnetic wave energy<A ID="tex2html43"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot859"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">43</SPAN></SUP></A>, but the &ldquo;stilling well&rdquo; property of a coaxial probe practically necessitates these equalization ports to ensure the interface level within the probe always matches the interface level in the rest of the vessel.
