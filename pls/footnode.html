<DT><A ID="foot791">... standard</A><A
 HREF="node1.html#tex2html1"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN></SUP></A></DT>
<DD>A &ldquo;de facto&rdquo; standard is one arising naturally out of legacy rather than by an premeditated agreement between parties.  Modbus and Profibus networks are considered &ldquo;de facto&rdquo; standards because those networks were designed, built, and marketed by pioneering firms prior to their acceptance as standards for others to conform to.  In Latin, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">de facto</SPAN> means &ldquo;from the fact,&rdquo; which in this case refers to the fact of pre-existence: a standard agreed upon to conform to something already in popular use.  By contrast, a standard intentionally agreed upon before its physical realization is a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">de jure</SPAN> standard (Latin for &ldquo;from the law&rdquo;).  FOUNDATION Fieldbus is an example of a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">de jure</SPAN> standard, where a committee arrives at a consensus for a network design and specifications prior to that network being built and marketed by any firm.

 HREF="node1.html#tex2html2"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN></SUP></A></DT>
<DD>It is worth noting the legitimacy of referencing virtual contacts to output bits (e.g. contact <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">Y5</SPAN>), and not just to input bits.  A &ldquo;virtual contact&rdquo; inside a PLC program is nothing more than an instruction to the PLC's processor to <SPAN  CLASS="textit">read</SPAN> the status of a bit in memory.  It matters not whether that bit is associated with a physical input channel, a physical output channel, or some abstract bit in the PLC's memory.  It would, however, be wrong to associate a virtual coil with an input bit, as coil instructions <SPAN  CLASS="textit">write</SPAN> bit values to memory, and input bits are supposed to be controlled solely by the energization states of their physical input channels.

<DD>The most modern Allen-Bradley PLCs have all but done away with fixed-location I/O addressing, opting instead for <SPAN  CLASS="textit">tag name</SPAN> based I/O addressing.  However, enough legacy Allen-Bradley PLC systems still exist in industry to warrant coverage of these addressing conventions.

<DD>This is not to say one <SPAN  CLASS="textit">cannot</SPAN> specify a particular bit in an otherwise whole word.  In fact, this is one of the powerful advantages of Allen-Bradley's addressing scheme: it gives you the ability to precisely specify portions of data, even if that data is not generally intended to be portioned into smaller pieces!

<DD>Referencing the Allen-Bradley engineering literature, we see that the accumulator word may alternatively be addressed by number rather than by mnemonic, <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">T4:2.2</SPAN> (word 2 being the accumulator word in the timer data structure), and that the &ldquo;done&rdquo; bit may be alternatively addressed as <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">T4:2.0/13</SPAN> (bit number 13 in word 0 of the timer's data structure).  The mnemonics provided by Allen-Bradley are certainly less confusing than referencing word and bit numbers for particular aspects of a timer's function!

 HREF="node1.html#tex2html8"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">8</SPAN></SUP></A></DT>
<DD>Some systems such as the Texas Instruments 505 series used &ldquo;X&rdquo; labels to indicate discrete input channels and &ldquo;Y&rdquo; labels to indicate discrete output channels (e.g. input <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">X9</SPAN> and output <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">Y14</SPAN>).  This same labeling convention is still used by Koyo in its DirectLogic and &ldquo;CLICK&rdquo; PLC models.  Siemens continues a similar tradition of I/O addressing by using the letter &ldquo;I&rdquo; to indicate discrete inputs and the letter &ldquo;Q&rdquo; to indicate discrete outputs (e.g. input channel <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">I0.5</SPAN> and output <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">Q4.1</SPAN>).

<DD>If this were a legacy Allen-Bradley PLC system using absolute addressing, we would be forced to address the three sensor inputs as <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">I:1/0</SPAN>, <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">I:1/1</SPAN>, and <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">I:1/2</SPAN> (slot 1, channels 0 through 2), and the indicator lamp output as <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">O:2/0</SPAN> (slot 2, channel 0).  If this were a newer Logix5000 Allen-Bradley PLC, the default tag names would be <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">Local:1:I.Data.0</SPAN>, <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">Local:1:I.Data.1</SPAN>, and <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">Local:1:I.Data.2</SPAN> for the three inputs, and <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">Local:2:O.Data.0</SPAN> for the output.  However, in either system we have the ability to assign symbolic addresses so we have a way to reference the I/O channels without having to rely on these cumbersome labels.  The programs showing in this book exclusively use tag names rather than absolute addresses, since this is the more modern programming convention.

<DD>The most likely reason why one out of two flame sensors might not detect the presence of a flame is some form of misalignment or fouling of the flame sensor.   In fact, this is a good reason for using a 2-out-of-3 flame detection system rather than a simplex (1-out-of-1) detector scheme: to make the system more tolerant of occasional sensor problems without compromising burner safety.

<DD>While it is possible to wire the overload contact to one of the PLC's discrete input channels and then program a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">virtual</SPAN> overload contact in series with the output coil to stop the motor in the event of a thermal overload, this strategy would rely on the PLC to perform a safety function which is probably better performed by hard-wired circuitry.

 HREF="node1.html#tex2html14"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">14</SPAN></SUP></A></DT>
<DD>A very common misconception among students first learning PLC Ladder Diagram programming is to always associate contacts with PLC inputs and coils with PLC outputs, thus it seems weird to have a contact bear the same label as an output.  However, this is a false association.  In reality, contacts and coils are <SPAN  CLASS="textit">read</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">write</SPAN> instructions, and thus it is possible to have the PLC read one of its own output bits as a part of some logic function.  What <SPAN  CLASS="textit">would</SPAN> be truly strange is to label a coil with an input bit address or tag name, since the PLC is not electrically capable of setting the real-world energization status of any input channels.

<DT><A ID="foot817">... confusing</A><A
 HREF="node1.html#tex2html15"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">15</SPAN></SUP></A></DT>
<DD>In an effort to alleviate this confusion, the Allen-Bradley corporation (Rockwell) uses the terms <SPAN  CLASS="textit">examine if closed</SPAN> (XIC) and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">examine if open</SPAN> (XIO) to describe &ldquo;normally open&rdquo; and &ldquo;normally closed&rdquo; virtual contacts, respectively, in their Ladder Diagram programming.  The idea here is that a virtual contact drawn as a normally-open symbol will be &ldquo;examined&rdquo; (declared &ldquo;true&rdquo;) by the PLC's processor if its corresponding input channel is energized (powered by a real-life contact in the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">closed</SPAN> state).  Conversely, a virtual contact drawn as a normally-closed symbol (with a slash mark through the middle) will be &ldquo;examined&rdquo; by the PLC's processor if its corresponding input channel is de-energized (if the real-life contact sending power to that terminal is in the open state).  In my experience, I have found this nomenclature to be even more confusing to students than simply calling these virtual contacts &ldquo;normally open&rdquo; and &ldquo;normally closed&rdquo; like other PLC manufacturers do.  The foundational concept for students to grasp here is that <SPAN  CLASS="textit">the virtual contact is not a direct representation of the real-life electrical switch contact &ndash; rather, it is a <SPAN ID="txt411">read instruction</SPAN> for the bit set by power coming from the real-life electrical switch contact</SPAN>.

<DD>This represents the IEC 61131-3 standard, where each variable within an instruction may be &ldquo;connected&rdquo; to its own arbitrary tag name.  Other programming conventions may differ somewhat.  The Allen-Bradley Logix5000 series of controllers is one of those that differs, following a convention reminiscent of structure element addressing in the C programming language: each counter is given a tag name, and variables in each counter are addressed as elements within that structure.  For example, a Logix5000 counter instruction might be named <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">parts_count</SPAN>, with the accumulated count value (equivalent to the IEC's &ldquo;current value&rdquo;) addressed as <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">parts_count.ACC</SPAN> (each element within the counter specified as a suffix to the counter's tag name).

<DD>The &ldquo;enable out&rdquo; (ENO) signal on the timer instruction serves to indicate the instruction's status: it activates when the enable input (EN) activates and de-activates when either the enable input de-activates or the instruction generates an error condition (as determined by the PLC manufacturer's internal programming).  The ENO output signal serves no useful purpose in this particular program, but it is available if there were any need for other rungs of the program to be &ldquo;aware&rdquo; of the run-time timer's status.

<DD>The enable (EN) input signals specified in the IEC 61131-3 programming standard make retentive off-delay timers possible (by de-activating the enable input while maintaining the &ldquo;IN&rdquo; input in an inactive state), but bear in mind that most PLC implementations of timers do not have separate EN and IN inputs.  This means (for most PLC timer instructions) the only input available to activate the timer is the &ldquo;IN&rdquo; input, in which case it is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">impossible</SPAN> to create a retentive off-delay timer (since such a timer's elapsed time value would be immediately re-set to zero each time the input re-activates).

This mask value tells the sequencer instruction to regard <SPAN  CLASS="textit">all</SPAN> bits of each <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">B3</SPAN> word that is read.  To contrast, if the mask were set to a value of 000F hexadecimal instead, the sequencer would only pay attention to the four least-significant bits of each <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">B3</SPAN> word that is read, while ignoring the 12 more-significant bits of each 16-bit word.  The mask allows the SQO instruction to only write to selected bits of the destination word, rather than always writing all 16 bits of the indexed word to the destination word.
